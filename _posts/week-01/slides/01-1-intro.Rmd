## Zoom practicalities

- Be muted by default, but feel free to unmute yourself to ask questions.

- Questions can also be asked in chat.

- *[Show other Zoom icons.]*

--

<br>

- Having your camera turned on as much as possible is appreciated!

--

<br>

- "Screen real estate" &mdash; large/multiple monitors or multiple devices best.
  
- Be ready to share your screen.

# Course Overview

----
<br><br><br>

---
class: inverse middle center

## The core goal of this course:

----
<br><br>

# Learning skills to do your research <br> more reproducibly and efficiently

<br> <br> <br> <br>

---

## Course background: Reproducibility

<br>

- Two related ideas:
  
  1. Getting same results with an independent experiment (*replicable*)
  
  2. Getting same results given the same data (*reproducible*)

  Our focus is on #2.

---

## Course background: Reproducibility (cont.)

<br>

.large[
> *"The most basic principle for reproducible research is: <br>Do everything via code."*
]

--

<br>

- Also important:

  - Organization and documentation (*week 2*)
  
  - Sharing data and code (*Github for code, week 3*)
  
  - How you code (*especially week 10 - Python, and 13 - Snakemake*)

--

<br>

- Another motivator: working reproducibly will benefit future you!

> *"Your closest collaborator is you six months ago, but you don’t reply to
> emails.”*   

---

## Course background: Efficiency and automation

<br>

- Using code enables you to work efficiently and largely automatically &mdash;
  particularly useful when having to:
  
  - Do repetitive tasks
  
  - Recreate a figure or redo an analysis after adding a sample
  
  - Redo everything after uncovering a mistake in the first data processing
   step.

# Course topics

<br>

.left[
### I: [The Unix shell & shell scripts](#shell)
### II: [Project organization and Markdown](#proj-org)
### III: [Version control](#git)
### IV: [Python](#python)
### V: [Automated workflow management](#snakemake)
]

---
name: shell

## Course topics I: <br> The Unix shell & shell scripts (Wk 1 & 4-6)

*Being able to work in the shell is a fundamental skill in
computational biology.*

<br>

- Week 1 (, 2), 4 and 5: Basics of working in the Unix shell.

- Week 6: Shell *scripting*.

- Week 7: Submitting shell scripts at OSC using *SLURM* directives.

---
name: proj-org

## Course topics II: <br> Project organization and Markdown (Wk 2)

*Good project organization and documentation is a necessary starting point
for reproducible research.*

<br>

- Best practices for project organization, file naming, etc.,  
  and how to use the Unix shell for this.

- To document and report what we are doing: *Markdown*.

---
name: git

## Course topics III: <br>Version control with Git and Github (Wk 3)

<br>

*Using version control, you can more effectively keep track of project
progress, collaborate, experiment, revisit earlier versions, and undo.*

<br>

- *Git* is the version control software we will use,  
  and *Github* is the website that hosts Git projects.

---
name: python

## Course topics IV: <br> Python (Wk 8-12)

<br>

*For data processing beyond what is best done in the shell, we need to use
a scripting language.*

<br>

- We'll use **Python**, which is very versatile and has a clear, human-readable
  syntax, making it relatively easy to learn.

--

<br>

.content-box-info[
- While Python will be the main programming language for the course,
  be warned: we will only be able to scratch the surface.
  
- We'll also emphasize general programming concepts and best practices
  in the Python part.
]

---
name: snakemake

## Course topics V: <br> Automated workflow management (Wk 13)

<br>

*To be able to run an entire analysis pipeline with a single command,   
  and easily change and rerun parts of it, we need a workflow manager.*

<br>

- We'll use **_Snakemake_**, which uses Python syntax.

- With limited extra effort, this allows us to make big gains!

---

## Course topics & general expectations

<br>

- We will cover a pretty broad array of topics,
  so you should see this as an *Introduction* to most of these topics.

<br>

- To get the most out of this course...

  - Read the readings and do the exercises.
  
  - Keep practicing and applying after the course!
