### [[Back to overview]](#overview)

---

## Terminology

| short | long | meaning |
|-|-|-|
| **dir** | directory | folder |
| **GUI** | Graphical User Interface | Point-and-click interface |
| **CLI** | Command Line Interface | Interface where you type commands |


---

## What is a shell?

- The shell is a **command-line interface (CLI) to the
  operating system**.

- A shell is always available on Unix-like operating systems,
  such as Linux and Mac. (In Windows, there are [ways to get one](#windows-shell).)

--

<br>

### Shell flavors

- Of many very similar shell variants, we will be using the **bash shell**.   
  
  This is most common shell -- e.g. the default in Mac and Linux,
  including at OSC.

---

## But what can I do in the shell?

--

- Manage and manipulate files.

--

- Run bioinformatics programs and submit scripts.

--

- Interact with remote computers, such as OSC clusters.

--

- ... While keeping track of what you've done.

---

## Let's open up a shell at OSC!

- The Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) allows us to use a shell   
  *within* a browser at <https://ondemand.osc.edu/>.

<br>

<p align = "center">
<img src=figs_shell/OSC_shell.png width="900">
</p>

<br>

- In the "`Clusters`" dropdown menu, click "`Pitzer Shell Access`".


---

## The shell prompt

- OSC shows us lots of welcome messages and information:

<p align="left">
<img src=figs_shell/OSC_welcome.png width="550">
</p>

<p align="center">
<img src=figs_shell/OSC_welcome2.png width="1000">
</p>

--

- And a **prompt** -- this is where we type.

<p align="center">
<img src=figs_shell/OSC_prompt.png width="900">

# In the shell, <br> we're mostly typing commands

### Basic usage is just memorizing commands for common utilities


---

## A first example: the "`cal`" command

- Just typing `cal` prints a calendar to screen:
  ```sh
  $ cal      # - I'm using a $ to indicate the prompt.
               # - Everything after a "#" is ignored.
  ```

--

  <p align="center">
  <img src=figs_shell/cal.png width="400">
  </p>

---

## A first example: the "`cal`" command

- Just typing `cal` prints a calendar to screen:
  ```sh
  $ cal      # - I'm using a $ to indicate the prompt.
               # - Everything after a "#" is ignored.
  ```

- We can use the "-j" or "-m" **options** (flags):
  ```sh
  $ cal -j    # Show a Julian calendar
  $ cal -m    # Have weeks start on Monday
  ```

--

- We can use a year as an **argument** (parameter):
  ```sh
  $ cal 2020  # Print the calendar for 2020
  ```

--

- We can combine options and arguments, e.g.:
  ```sh
  $ cal -j -m 2020
  
  $ cal -jm 2020     # Shorter notation!
  ```

---

## What we've learned from `cal`

- After typing a command, we issue it using `Enter`, the result will
  be printed to screen, and we get our prompt back.
  
- We can use **options (flags) and arguments (parameters)** <br> to
  modify or determine what a command does.

- These arguments and options are **separated by spaces**.

--

<br>

.content-box-purple[
`r icon::fa("info-circle")` &nbsp; Everything after a **"`#`"** is ignored -- useful for comments!
]

---

## How can we know a command's options?

Many commands have a "**-h**" help option:

```sh
$ cal -h
# Usage:
#  cal [options] [[[day] month] year]

# Options:
#  -1, --one        show only current month (default)
#  -3, --three      show previous, current and next month
#  -s, --sunday     Sunday as first day of week
#  -m, --monday     Monday as first day of week
#  -j, --julian     output Julian dates
#  -y, --year       show whole current year
#  -V, --version    display version information and exit
#  -h, --help       display this help text and exit
```

- Note the short ("**-h**") vs long ("**--help**") option notation!

---

## How can we know a command's options? (cont.)

- Using the **`man`** ("manual") command,   
  whose argument is the command or utility we want the manual for:
  ```sh
  $ man ls
  ```

<br><br><br><br>

### [[Back to overview]](#overview)

---

## Commands for navigation: Overview

.pull-left[
### `pwd`
**P**rint **W**orking **D**irectory

<br>

### `cd`
**C**hange (working) **D**irectory
]

.pull-right[
### `ls`
**L**i**S**t files and directories
]

---

## Commands for navigation: Overview

```sh
$ pwd   # Print Working Directory (where am I?)

$ cd    # Change (working) Directory

$ ls    # LiSt files and dirs in your current working directory
```

<br>

- Which of these commands might need an *argument*?

--

```sh
$ cd destination_dir
```

---

## Navigation: `pwd`

To let the shell tell you what your working directory is, <br> use **`pwd`**
(**P**rint **W**orking **D**irectory):

  ```sh
  $ pwd
  # /users/PAS0471/jelmer/
  ```

--

<br>

- Notice that directories are separated by **forward slashes "`/`"** <br> in Unix
  environments.

<br>

---

## Navigation: `cd`

To change working directory, use **`cd`** (**C**hange **D**irectory).

- Using an **absolute path** (i.e., starting from the root dir):
  ```{sh, eval=FALSE}
  $ cd /fs/project/PAS0471/
  ```

--

.content-box-green[
### `r icon::fa("user-edit")` Try this:
  - Shells have tab completion!
    - Type `/f` and press `Tab` (will autocomplete to `fs/`)
    - Then add `pr` (`/fs/pr`) and press `Tab`
    - Add `PAS` (`fs/project/PAS`) and press `Tab Tab`
    - Add `04` (`fs/project/PAS04`) and press `Tab Tab`
    
  - You can paste text into your OSC browser shell using **`Ctrl` + `v`**
]

---

## Navigation: `cd`

To change working directory, use **`cd`** (**C**hange **D**irectory).

- Using an **absolute path** (i.e., starting from the root dir):
  ```{sh, eval=FALSE}
  $ cd /fs/project/PAS0471/
  ```

- Using a **relative path** (i.e., not starting from the root dir):
  ```sh
  $ cd workshops/2020-12_micro/$USER
  # Absolute: /fs/project/PAS0471/workshops/2020-12_micro/$USER
  ```

--

<br>

- **The shell does not give us any feedback when it succeeds.**

  Check whether it worked:
  ```sh
  $ pwd
  # /fs/project/PAS0471/workshops/2020-12_micro/jelmer
  ```

---

## Navigation: `cd`

To change working directory, use **`cd`** (**C**hange **D**irectory).

- Using an **absolute path** (i.e., starting from the root dir):
  ```{sh, eval=FALSE}
  $ cd /fs/project/PAS0471/
  ```
  
- Using a **relative path** (i.e., not starting from the root dir):
  ```sh
  $ cd workshops/2020-12_micro/$USER
  # Absolute: /fs/project/PAS0471/workshops/2020-12_micro/$USER
  ```

<br>

- **The shell does not give us any feedback when it succeeds.**

  What happens when I make a mistake?
  ```sh
  $ cd sdkjgkhh
  # bash: cd: sdkjgkhh: No such file or directory
  ```

---

## Navigation: `cd` (cont.)

### Tricks!

```sh
$ cd ~      # Move to your home dir (~ is always /home/<user>/ !)

$ cd ..     # Move one directory up
$ cd ../..  # Move two directories up

$ cd -      # Go back to last visited dir (like "Back" in a browser)

$ cd .      # This doesn't move you anywhere, as `.` is a shortcut
            # for the current working directory (useful elsewhere)
```

---

## Navigation: `ls`

- To list the contents of your current working directory, use **`ls`**
  (**L**i**S**t).
  ```sh
  $ ls
  ```
  <p align="center">
  <img src=figs_shell/ls.png width="700">
  </p>

--

- Useful options to modify the output:
  ```sh
  $ ls -lh   # -l: long format / -h: human-readable file sizes
  ```
  <p align="center">
  <img src=figs_shell/ls-lh.png width="700">
  </p>

---

## Navigation: `ls` (cont.)

- We can also provide a directory or file name as an argument:
  ```sh
  $ ls -lh metadata
  ```
  
  <p align="center">
  <img src=figs_shell/ls-metadata.png width="500">
  </p>
  
--
  
  ```sh
  $ ls -lh metadata/Experiment description
  # ls: cannot access Experiment: No such file or directory
  # ls: cannot access description: No such file or directory
  ```

  What just happened? And how do we get around this?

--

- **To interpret spaces literally**, quote the full string or "escape" the space:
  ```sh
  $ ls "Experiment description"     # Quote the file name
  
  $ ls Experiment\ description      # Escape the space with a "\"
  ```

--

- **But, better to avoid spaces in file names!**

name:stdin

# Standard Input/Output and Pipes

----

<br><br><br><br>

### [[Back to overview]](#overview)

---

## Standard output and redirection

- The regular output of a command is called **"standard out"** ("*stdout*").   
  By default, this is printed to screen,
  but it can be "redirected" to a file.

--

- With "**`>`**", we **redirect** output to a file:
  - If the file doesn't exist, it will be *created*.
  - If the file does exist, any contents will be *overwritten*. 
  
  ```sh
  $ ls -lhr data/raw > list_of_files.txt
  ```

--

- With "**`>>`**", we **append** the output to a file:
  ```sh
  $ ls -lhr metadata >> list_of_files.txt
  ```

--

<br>

.content-box-purple[
`r icon::fa("info-circle")` &nbsp; **Error messages** are also printed to screen but
are **not** part of   
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; standard out. See the [bonus materials](#stderr) to learn
about redirecting   
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; error messages.
]

---

## Standard input and pipes

- A file name can be given as an argument to most commands.

  This "`grep`" command will search for the string "soil_blank"
  inside the contents of our metadata file:
  ```sh
  $ grep "soil_blank" metadata/sample_meta.txt
  ```

--

<br>

- Most commands *also* accept input from "standard input" (*stdin*),   
  using the **pipe**, "**`|`**":
  ```sh
  $ cat metadata/sample_meta.txt | grep "soil_blank"
  ```
  
  Here, the pipe presents the standard output (*stdout*) of `cat` as   
  input (*stdin*) to `grep`.

# Managing Files

----

<br><br><br><br>

### [[Back to overview]](#overview)

---

## Commands to manage files: Overview

.pull-left[
### `mkdir`
Make a new dir

<br>

### `cp`
Copy files (and dirs)
]

--

.pull-right[
### `mv`
Move or rename files and dirs

<br>

### `rm`
Remove files (and dirs)
]

---

## Commands to manage files

```sh
$ mkdir <dirname> # Make a new directory
$ cp <from> <to>  # Copy files (and/or directories)
$ mv <from> <to>  # Move or rename files and/or directories
$ rm <file>       # Remove files (and/or directories)
                  # BEWARE: There is no Thrash Bin in the shell!
```

<br>

--

- Examples:
  
  ```sh
  mkdir figures/
  mkdir -p manuscript/fig/supp/      # "-p": multiple levels
  ```
  
--

  ```sh
  cp metadata/sample_meta.txt .      # "." for current wd            
  ```
  
  ```sh
  mv sample_meta.txt meta.txt
  ```
  ```sh
  rm meta.tx
  ```

  
---

## Commands to manage files (cont.)

```sh
$ mkdir <dirname> # Make a new directory
$ cp <from> <to>  # Copy files (and/or directories)
$ mv <from> <to>  # Move or rename files and/or directories
$ rm <file>       # Remove files (and/or directories)
                  # BEWARE: There is no Thrash Bin in the shell!
```

<br>

- For `cp` and `rm`, use **"`-r`"** (for "recursive") to act on directories
  and their contents:
  ```sh
  cp -r data/raw/ backup/
    
  rm -r backup/      # Confirm removal for each file
  rm -rf backup/     # `-f` for force, no prompting
  ```

--

- The `-r` option is not needed with `mv`.

class:inverse middle center
name:wildcards

# Wildcards

----

<br><br><br><br>

### [[Back to overview]](#overview)

---

## Matching file names with wildcards

|Wildcard | Matches |
|-|-|
| * | Any number of any character, including nothing |
| ? | Any single character 
| [] and [^] | One or none (`^`) of the "character set" within the brackets   

--

- Say we have the following files in a directory:
  ```sh
  # sample1_F.fastq.gz sample1_R.fastq.gz
  # sample2_F.fastq.gz sample2_R.fastq.gz
  # sample3_F.fastq.gz sample3_R.fastq.gz
  ```

--

- **To match both "sample1" files:**
  ```sh
  ls sample1_?.fastq.gz
  ls sample1*
  ls sample1*fastq.gz
  ```

---

## Matching file names with wildcards (cont.)

|Wildcard | Matches |
|-|-|
| * | Any number of any character, including nothing |
| ? | Any single character 
| [] and [^] | One or none (`^`) of the "character set" within the brackets   

- Say we have the following files in a directory:
  ```sh
  # sample1_F.fastq.gz sample1_R.fastq.gz
  # sample2_F.fastq.gz sample2_R.fastq.gz
  # sample3_F.fastq.gz sample3_R.fastq.gz
  ```

- **To match only files with forward ("F) reads:**
  ```sh
  $ ls *F*
  $ ls *F.fastq.gz
  ```

---

## Matching file names with wildcards (cont.)

|Wildcard | Matches |
|-|-|
| * | Any number of any character, including nothing |
| ? | Any single character 
| [] and [^] | One or none (`^`) of the "character set" within the brackets   

- Say we have the following files in a directory:
  ```sh
  # sample1_F.fastq.gz sample1_R.fastq.gz
  # sample2_F.fastq.gz sample2_R.fastq.gz
  # sample3_F.fastq.gz sample3_R.fastq.gz
  ```

- When using a "character set", the presence of *any* of the characters will
  trigger a match. **To match files for sample1 and sample2 only:**
  ```sh
  $ ls sample[12]*   # Use the character class notation
  $ ls sample[1-2]*  # Can use ranges like [0-9], [A-Z], [a-z].
  $ ls sample[^3]*   # Other way around: exclude sample3
  ```

## `r icon::fa("user-edit")` Your turn: Navigation, managing files & wildcards

1. Go to "`/fs/project/PAS0471/workshops/2020-12_micro/$USER`"
  (if not there already).
   **This is your base directory for this workshop.**

2. Rename "`metadata/Experiment description`" to
  "`metadata/Experiment_description`".

3. Check whether this worked.

4. Move up one dir (to "`2020-12_micro`") --
   try to avoid using the absolute (full) path notation.

5. Using an **`ls`** command, match *only your* directory
   using as few characters as possible, and one or more wildcards
   (**`*`** and perhaps **`?`**).

---

# 2. Rename "`metadata/Experiment description`".
$ mv "metadata/Experiment description" metadata/Experiment_description

# 3. Check whether this worked.
$ ls metadata

# 4. Move one level up.
$ cd ..

# 5. Match your directory.

# Viewing Text Files

<br><br><br><br>

### [[Back to overview]](#overview)


---

## Commands to view text files: Overview

.pull-left[
### `cat`
Print the contents of (a) file(s).   

<br>

### `head` / `tail`
Show the first or last lines of a file.
]

--

.pull-right[
### (In bonus materials: [`less`](#less))
]

---

## Text files: `cat`

- `cat` will print one or more files, by default to screen.   
  ```sh
  $ cat metadata/sample_meta.txt
  
  $ cat metadata/sample_meta.txt > tmp.txt
  ```

--

- If you have 10,000 `fasta` files in a directory
  (e.g. one per gene), and you want to put them all into
  a single `fasta` file:
  ```sh
  $ cat *.fasta > all.fasta        # Recall the `*` wildcard  
  ```

--

<br>

.content-box-purple[
`r icon::fa("info-circle")` &nbsp; Try "`column -t`" for better viewing of tabular files.
]

---

## Text files: `head` and `tail`

- `head` / `tail` will simply show the first / last few lines of a file.
  ```sh
  $ head my_file.txt        # Default: shows first/last 10 lines
  
  $ tail -n 1 my_file.txt   # Just show the last/first line
  ```

- Showing the last line of a 100 GB file outside of the
  shell can be a big pain -- in the shell it's
  very simple and fast!

--

<br>

- Skip the first line of a file (*cut off the header*, if you only want the data):
  ```sh
  $ tail -n +2 file
  ```

--

- Print line number 1866:
  ```sh
  $ head -n 1866 file | tail -n 1
  ```

## Assigning and using variables

.pull-left[
**Assign** a variable (no **`$`**):

```sh
# Any string:
my_name=Jelmer
```
]

.pull-right[
**Recall** a variable (with **`$`**):

```sh
$ echo $my_name
# Jelmer
  ```
]

--

.pull-left[
```sh
# A file name:
my_file="README.txt"
```
]

.pull-right[
```sh
$ ls -lh $my_file
# -rw-r--r-- 1 jelmer PAS0471 568 Dec  7 09:58 README.txt
```
]

--

.pull-left[  
```sh
# Use "command substitution"
# to assign a command's output
today=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
```
]

.pull-right[
```sh
$ touch README_$today.txt
$ ls README_*
# README_2020-12-10.txt
```
]

--

.pull-left[
Pre-existing variables:
("**Environment variables**")
]

.pull-right[
```sh
$ echo $USER
# jelmer
```
]

--

---

## Assigning and using variables (cont.)

- **It can be useful to use variables for things that:**
  
  - May be subject to change over time or in reruns (dir names, settings).
  
  - Need to be manipulated.
  
  - Are re-used often.


---

## A very minimal script

- Create and run a very simple script:
  ```sh
  $ echo 'echo "Hello $1"' > hello.sh
  
  $ bash hello.sh Jelmer
  # Hello Jelmer
  ```

--

.pull-left[
- Or, assign a variable first:
  ```sh
  $ my_name=Jelmer
  $ hello.sh $my_name
  # Hello Jelmer
  ```
]

.pull-right[
- Or use `$USER`:
  ```sh
  $ hello.sh $USER
  # Hello jelmer
  ```
]

--

- We can also redirect the output to a file:
  ```sh
  $ hello.sh Jelmer > hello.txt
  
  $ cat hello.txt
  # Hello Jelmer
  ```

- `Ctrl` + `v` will paste (no `Shift` needed)

- `Ctrl` + `w` (cut last word) does not work --   
  reserved browser shortcut to close a tab.

## Text files: `grep`

`grep` searches for strings
(or regular expression patterns) in files.   
By default, it returns lines for which matches were found.

- Count the number of lines containing "exon": 
  ```sh
  grep -c "exon" my.gff   # -c: count matches
  ```

--

- Remove the header lines, which start with a `#`, from a VCF file:
  ```sh  
  grep -v "^#" my.vcf     # -v: reverse search  
  ```

--

Many options, e.g.:
  - `-r` to search recursively (search all your files for a certain word)
  - `-n` to print line numbers along with matches

## Text file data tools

- **`cut`**: cut (select) one or more columns from a tabular file
  ```sh
  $ cut -f 2-5 < my.gff   # Cut the 2nd through 5th column 
  ```

- **`wc` / `wc -l`**: count words / lines.
  ```sh
  $ wc -l my.fastq   # Count the number of lines in a fastq file.
  ```

--

<br>

- **`sort`**: sort a file by a specified column
  ```sh
  $ sort -k5,5 my.bed
  ```
  
- **`uniq` / `uniq -c`**: retain / count unique occurrences (*if in order!*)
  ```sh
  $ uniq -c list_of_names.txt # Would return count for each name
  ```

## Combining these tools can be very powerful!

For instance, the "pipeline" below will return a sorted list (most commmon
to least common) of annotation types from an annotation file<sup>[1]</sup>:

```sh
$ grep -v "^#" my.gff | cut -f3 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
# 36128 exon
# 25901 CDS
# 7588 UTR
# ...
```

--

- Command-by-command (note **`\`** to continue across lines):
  ```sh
  $ grep -v "^#" my.gff | \ # Excl. header lines starting with `#`
  +   cut -f3 | \           # Select only the 3rd column
  +   sort | \              # Sort alphabetically
  +   uniq -c | \           # Count each unique element
  +   sort -rn              # Numerically reverse-sort
  ```

## `r icon::fa("user-edit")` Your turn: Working with text files I

**Now, we'll look at a file with some metadata for our samples.**

1. Move into the `metadata` folder within our workshop's home directory (`/fs/project/PAS0471/workshops/2020-12_micro/`).

1. Print the entire file to screen with `cat` and with `column -t`.
   Compare the output, especially in the first lines of the file.

2. Print the first 6 lines of the file, then make them line up with
  `column -t`.

2. Print everything but the first line, which has the column headers.

3. Print the line for sample "304-S1".

## Solutions: Working with text files I

1. Move into the `metadata` folder:
  ```sh
  mv metadata/
  ```

1. Print the entire file to screen with `cat` and with `column -t`:
  ```sh
  cat V4_meta.txt
  column -t V4_meta.txt
  ```
  
2. Print the first 6 lines of the file, then make them line up with
  `column -t`:
  ```sh
  head V4_meta.txt | column -t
  ```
  
2. Print everything but the first line, which has the column headers:
  ```sh
  tail -n +2
  ```

3. Print the line for sample "304-S1":
  ```sh
  grep "304-S1" V4_meta.txt
  ```

## `r icon::fa("user-edit")` Your Turn: Working with text files II

1. How many samples (lines) do we have for each "Experiment"?

2. How many different "Blocks" do we have?   
   Hint: Make sure to exclude the lines which have "NA" in the "Blocks" column.

3. Earlier, with `less`, we looked for the pattern *"GAGTGCCAGCCGCCGCGGTAATACGTAGGGTGCGAGCGTTAATCGGAATTACTGGGC"*    
  in the file `data/fastq/502-S4-V4-V5_S66_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz`.
  
  Now, count how many times this pattern occurs in the file using `grep`.

## Solutions: Working with text files II

1. How many samples (lines) do we have for each "Experiment"?
  ```sh
  tail -n +2 V4_meta.txt | cut -f 3 | sort | uniq -c
  ```

2. How many different "Blocks" do we have?
  ```sh
  $ tail -n +2 V4_meta.txt | grep -v "NA" | \
  +    cut -f 6 | sort | uniq | wc -l
  ```

3. Count occurences of
  *"GAGTGCCAGCCGCCGCGGTAATACGTAGGGTGCGAGCGTTAATCGGAATTACTGGGC"*
  in the file `data/fastq/502-S4-V4-V5_S66_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz`.
  ```sh
  $ grep -c "GAGTGCCAGCCGCCGCGGTAATACGTAGGGTGCGAGCGTTAATCGGAATTACTGGGC" \
  +      data/fastq/502-S4-V4-V5_S66_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
  ```

background-color: #ededed

## The `less` pager

- `less` doesn't load entire files into memory: **easy to look at large files**.
  ```sh
  $ less my_file.txt
  
  $ zless my_fastq.gz    # `zless` variant to view zipped files!
  ```

- Now you'll be inside the pager, and your prompt is gone.

--

- Keyboard shortcuts:

| key | function |
|--|--|
| `q` | Exit `less` | 
| `d` / `u` | Go down / up half a page. <br>Note: arrow keys and `pgup` / `pgdn` usually also work.|
| `g` / `G` | Go to the first / last line (`home` / `end` also work)
|`/` | Search: next type keyword to search for
| `n` / `N` | Go to next/previous search match

## Your turn: `less`

You should still be in our workshop's home directory (`/fs/project/PAS0471/workshops/2020-12_micro/`).

This directory contains the data we will be working with today and tomorrow.
In `data/fastq`, you can find the raw gzipped fastq files.

- Open a gzipped fastq file with `less`:
  ```{sh, eval=FALSE}
  zless data/fastq/502-S4-V4-V5_S66_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
  ```

- Try to move around a bit.

- Jump to the first and last line.

- Now look for the following pattern:
  "GAGTGCCAGCCGCCGCGGTAATACGTAGGGTGCGAGCGTTAATCGGAATTACTGGGC"

- Exit.

## Standard error

- When commands run into errors, they will print error messages.  
  
  Error messages are **not** part of standard out,   
  and instead represent a separate output stream: **"standard error"**.

--

- We can see this when we try to list a non-existing directory:
  ```sh
  ls -lhr solutions/ > solution_files.txt 
  # ls: cannot access solutions.txt: No such file or directory
  ```

- The error was printed to screen. What about the file?

--

  ```sh
  $ ls
  # solution_files.txt
  $ cat solution_files.txt
  $                # We just get our prompt back - file is empty
  ```

--

- To redirect the standard error:
  ```sh
  ls -lhr solutions/ > solution_files.txt 2> errors.txt
  ls -lhr solutions/ &> out.txt # `&>`: combine stdout and stderr
  ```
