# Some Best Practices for <br> Project Organization

## Importance of Good Project Organization

<br>

**Good project organization and documentation facilitates:**

- Collaborating with others and yourself in the future

- Reproducibility

- Automation

- Version control

<br>

In short, it is a necessary foundation for our goals and tools in this course.

---

## Project organization &ndash; some underlying principles

<br>

- One dir hierarchy for one project, and:

  - Separate code from data

  - Separate raw data from processed data

<br>

--

- Use dir and file naming that is machine-readable, human-readable,  
  and works well with default ordering

<br>

- Treat raw data as read-only (and treat generated output as disposable)

<br>

- Slow down and document

---

## One dir hierarchy for one project

Having a single directory hierarchy for each project:

- Is beneficial for finding files, sharing your project,
  not throwing stuff away in error, etc.

- Will allow you to use *relative paths* within projects,  
  such that your paths in scripts are portable

**Absolute vs relative paths:**
  - *Absolute* -- starting from the root directory (start with `/`)
  - *Relative* -- starting from the current location (*working dir*)
]

## But what is a project, really?

<br>

From [Wilson et al 2017 - Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510):

> *As a rule of thumb, divide work into projects based on the overlap in data and*
> *code files.*
>
> *If 2 research efforts share no data or code,*
> *they will probably be easiest to manage independently.*  
>
> *If they share more than half of their data and code, they are probably best*
> *managed together.*

> *If you are building tools that are used in several projects,*
> *the common code should probably be in a project of its own.*

---

## Projects with shared data or code

- To access files outside of the project (e.g., shared across projects),  
  it is easiest to create file links:

<p align="center">
<img src=img/proj-shared-1.png width=60%>
</p>


---

## Projects with shared data or code (cont.)

- Shared data or scripts may be best stored in a separate dir,  
  and then linked to from each project using them:
  
<p align="center">
<img src=img/proj-shared-2.png width=60%>
</p>

--

.content-box-warning[
These methods do decrease the portability of your project,  
and moving the shared files even within your own computer  
will cause links to break.
]

---

## Projects with shared data or code (cont.)

A more portable method is to keep shared files online &ndash;  
this is especially feasible for **scripts** under version control,  
which can be synced to and accessed from an online repository:

<p align="center">
<img src=img/proj-shared-3.png width=80%>
</p>

--

For **data**, something similar can apply once the data have been  
deposited in a public repository.

## An example dir structure for a project

<img src=img/proj-ex3.png width=20%>
</p>

### Add sandbox!

- Can also use `analysis` dir instead of `results` (Buffalo)
- Can also spread data across top-level dirs: `raw_data`, `processed_data`, `metadata`
- Use subdirectories liberally (e.g. within `analysis`, `scripts`)
- Add READMEs also within dirs.


---

## File naming

- Three principles for good file names
  ([Jenny Bryan](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files)):

  - Machine-readable

  - Human-readable

  - Playing well with default ordering

---

## File naming: Machine-readable

Consistent and informative naming helps to programmatically find  
and process files.

- In file names, provide *metadata* like Sample ID, date, treatment:
  
  - `sample032_2016-05-03_low.txt`  
  
  - `soil-samples_trtA_2019-01.txt`
  
- *Suffices*, like `.txt`, `.md`, and `.csv` are generally not necessary
  in Unix,  
  but are still useful to distinguish file types easily and programmatically.

<br>

Spaces in file names lead to inconvenience or trouble:
  
```sh
$ rm -rf raw sequences
```

- More generally, only use alphanumeric characters <kbd>A-Za-z0-9</kbd>,  
  underscore <kbd>_</kbd>, hyphen <kbd>-</kbd> and dots/periods <kbd>.</kbd>
  in file names.
  
---

## File naming: Human-readable

> *"Name all files to reflect their content or function.*
> *For example, use names such as bird_count_table.csv, manuscript.md,*
> *or sightings_analysis.py.*"  
> [Wilson et al. 2017](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)
  
---

## File naming: Combining machine- and human-readable

- *One* good way (opinionated recommendation):
  
  - Use **`_`** to delimit units you may want to separate on later:  
    sampleID, treatment, date, etc.
  
  - Use **`-`** to delimit words: `grass-samples`.
  
  - Use periods only prior to the file extension:  
    `sample005_treatmentG_aligned_sorted.bam`
  
  - Avoid capitals.
  
---

## File naming: Ordering

- Leading zeros for lexicographic sorting: `sample005`.

- Dates should always be written as `YYYY-MM-DD`: `2020-10-11`.

- Can group similar files together by starting with same phrase:
  ```sh
  DE-01-normalize.R
  DE-02-test.R
  DE-03-process.R
  ```

## TODO: ADD FILE NAME EXAMPLES

---

## Slow down and document

<br>

**Use README files to document:**
  
- Your methods
  
- Where/when/how each data and metadata file originated
  
- Versions of software, databases, reference genomes
  
- *...Everything needed to rerun whole project*
  
---

## Slow down and document (cont.)

### An ode to plain text files

Unlike proprietary & binary formats (like `.docx` and `.xlsx`),
**plain text files**:

- Can be accessed on any computer, including over remote connections

- Are future-proof

- Allow to be version-controlled

<br>

These considerations apply not just to files for documentation,  
but also to data files, etc!

## Bonus: Managing software

- Keep track of the versions of software that you use!

- At OSC, load modules *with* a version specification --
  otherwise, you may not know what you used,
  and default versions changes can go unnoticed.
  
- `conda` environments can be useful too,
  e.g. for maintaining multiple versions of the same software,
  or being able to run mutually incompatible software.

- We'll talk more about this in the OSC (Week 6) and Snakemake (Week 12) modules.
