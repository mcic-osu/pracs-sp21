## Getting set up at OSC

- **Launch VS Code**:  
  Go to &lt;https://ondemand.osc.edu&gt; =&gt; `Interactive Apps` =&gt;
  `Code Server` =&gt; 1 or 2 hours =&gt; `Launch` ... =&gt; `Connect to VS Code`.
  
- **Open your workspace**:  
  On the *Welcome* page, under the heading `Recent`,
  your workspace should be listed ("`&lt;workspace-name&gt; (Workspace)`").
  
- **Open a terminal in VS Code:**  
  (&lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;backtick&lt;/kbd&gt;
  or <i class="fas  fa-bars "></i> =&gt; `Terminal` =&gt; `New Terminal`),
  and issue the command `bash` to break out of the Singularity shell.

----

- **Load the Git module:**
  ```sh
  $ module load git
  ```

- **Move to the following dir:**
  ```sh
  $ cd week03/originspecies # From /fs/ess/PAS1855/users/$USER/
  ```

# Remote repositories on GitHub

----

&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

---

## Remote repositories

We have been locally version-controlling our `originspecies` repo,  
but now we also want to **put this repo online**, to:

- Share our work and/or

- Have an online backup and/or

- Collaborate with others.

&lt;br&gt;

We will use the **GitHub website** as the place to host our online repositories.

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-info[
Online counterparts of repositories that we also have locally are usually
referred to as "remote repositories" or "remotes".

To add and manage remotes, we use the `git remote` command.
]

---

## Creating remote repositories

While we can *interact* with online repos using Git commands,  
we **can't _create_ a new online repo with the Git CLI**.

So, we need to go to the GitHub website to create a new online repo.

--

&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

.content-box-info[
VS Code does provide functionality to create GitHub repos directly.
We may look at this later in the course, but if you're interested,
look for the `GitLens` extension by Eric Amodio.
]

---

## Create a GitHub repo (cont.)

1. Go to &lt;https://github.com&gt; and sign in.

2. In the top-right, click the `+` next to your avatar and then select  
   `New repository`.

&lt;p align="center"&gt;

2. In the top-right, click the `+` next to your avatar and then select  
   `New repository`.
   
3. In the box `Repository name`, we'll use the same name that we gave to our
   local directory: `originspecies`.  
   (*Note:* these names don't *have to* match up.)

## Link up the local and remote repositories

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src=img/github-newrepo2.png width=63%&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

.content-box-info[
You can click on the `HTTPS`/`SSH` button to change the URL type.
]

---

## Link up the local and remote repositories (cont.)

We go back to the shell, where we'll enter the commands that GitHub provided
to us under "*...or push an existing repository from the command line*".

- First, we tell Git to add a "remote" connection with `git remote`.  
  We provide three arguments to this command:
  
  - `add` &amp;ndash; because we're adding a remote.
  
  - `origin` &amp;ndash; the nickname we're giving the connection.  
    This is an arbitrary name but is usually *origin* by convention.   
  
  - The SSH URL to the GitHub repo.

  ```sh
  # git remote add &lt;remote-nickname&gt; &lt;URL&gt;
  $ git remote add origin git@github.com:&lt;user&gt;/originspecies.git
  ```

---

## Link up the local and remote repositories (cont.)

- Second, we rename the default branch, from `master` to `main`
  (GitHub since recently uses `main` as the default branch):
  ```sh
  $ git branch -M main
  ```

- Third, we push our local repo to remote using `git push`.  
  Whenever we push a branch for the first time,  
  we need to use the `-u` option to set up an "**u**pstream" counterpart:
  ```sh
  $ git push -u origin main
  ```

--

.content-box-info[
When not given any arguments, `git push` pushes:
 - To &amp; from the **currently active *branch*** (default: `master`/`main`)
 - To the **default remote connection**.

Therefore, from now on, we can mostly just use:

```sh
$ git push
```
]

---

## Explore the repository on GitHub

- Back at GitHub, click on `Code` in the lower of the top bars.  
  Now, we can see the files that we just uploaded from our local repo.

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="img/github-code-button.png" width="50%"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

- Next, click where it says `x commits` (should be 4) with a clock icon,  
  and you'll get an overview of commits somewhat like with `git log`.

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="img/github-x-commits.png" width="40%"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

--

- On the right hand side, there are three buttons for each commit:

  - Click the hash (hexadecimal ID) to see changes made by that commit.
  
  - Click the &lt;kbd&gt;&lt; &gt;&lt;/kbd&gt; to see the state of the repo at the time
    of that commit.
  
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="img/github-commits.png" width="35%"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

---

## Remote repos &amp;ndash; Single-user workflow

In a single-user workflow, all changes are made in the *local repo*,  
and the remote repo is simply periodically updated (*pushed to*).

So, the interaction between local and remote is unidirectional:

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="img/git-remote-1.svg" width="55%"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

---

## Remote repos &amp;ndash; Single-user workflow (cont.)

In our day-to-day work, we now commit as usual, and in addition,  
*push* to remote occasionally:

- Let's add a README.md file, and commit:
  ```sh
  $ echo "# Origin" &gt; README.md
  $ echo "Repo for book draft on my new **theory**" &gt;&gt; README.md
  $ git add README.md
  $ git commit -m "Added a README"
  ```

- Now, we push to the remote repository:
  ```sh
  $ git push
  ```

--

.content-box-info[
If we go back to GitHub, we see that the contents of the README.md
automatically shows up as a rendered Markdown file!
]

---

## Remote repos &amp;ndash; Multi-user workflow

- First, a second user downloads (*clones*) the online repo:

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="img/git-remote-mult-1.svg" width="55%"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

---

## Remote repos &amp;ndash; Multi-user workflow

- Then, the second user can push their changes to the shared remote:  

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="img/git-remote-mult-2.svg" width="55%"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

---

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="img/git-remote-mult-3.svg" width="55%"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

---

## Remote repos &amp;ndash; Multi-user workflow

- To go full circle, you *pull* in
  the changes made by the second user: 

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="img/git-remote-mult-4.svg" width="55%"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

---

## Remote repos &amp;ndash; Multi-user workflow

- To go full circle, you *pull* in
  the changes made by the second user **(b)**. 

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="img/git-remote-mult-4.svg" width="40%"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

.content-box-info[
`git pull` is two commands in one: `git fetch` to download the updates
from remote and store them in a branch,
and `git merge` to merge the newly fetched branch into you current branch.
]

---

## Remote repos &amp;ndash; Multi-user workflow

.content-box-info[
**Recap:**  

With a multi-user workflow, changes made by different users are *shared via
the online copy of the repo.*

*Syncing is not automatic*:

- Changes to your local repo remain local-only until you **push** to remote.

- Someone else's changes to the remote repo do not make it into your
  local repo until you **pull** from remote.

But Git will tell you about "divergence" between local remote,
when you check `git status`:
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="img/git-sync.png" width="90%"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
]

---

## What can you do with &lt;br&gt; someone else's GitHub repository?

If you do not have rights to *push*, you can:
  
  - **Clone** the repo and make changes locally (as we do with `CSB`).  
    You can also *pull* to remain up-to-date with changes in the original repo. 
  
  - **Fork** the repository on GitHub and develop it independently.  
    Forking creates *a new personal GitHub repo*, to which you can push.
  
  - Using a forked repo, you can also submit a **Pull Request** with proposed
    changes to the *original repo*.

.content-box-info[
See [these bonus slides]((#pr) for more info on a fork =&gt; Pull Request workflow.
]

--

.content-box-info[
If you're collaborating on a project,
you should ask your collaborator to give you admin rights for the repo.
]

---

## GitHub Issues

- Each GitHub repository has "Issues" tab &amp;ndash; issues are mainly used to
  track bugs and other (potential) problems with a repository.

- In an issue, you can reference specific commits and people,
  and use Markdown formatting.
  
- In your Graded Assignment for this week, you will create an issue simply
  to notify me about your repository.

.content-box-info[
**Forking**, **Pull Requests**, and **Issues** are Git*Hub* functionality,  
and not part of Git.

# Branching &amp; merging

----

&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

---

## A repo with a couple of commits

- First, we create a dummy repo with a few commits by running a script:
  ```sh
  $ cd /fs/ess/PAS1855/users/$USER/CSB/git/sandbox
  
  # Have a look at the script:
  $ less ../data/create_repository.sh  # press `q` to exit less
  
  # Run the script, which will create our repo:
  $ ../data/create_repository.sh
  
  # Move to the repo dir:
  $ cd branching_example
  ```

--

- Let's see what has been done in this repo:
  ```sh
  $ git log --oneline # --oneline: 1-line summary per commit
  ```

- We will later modify the file `code.txt` &amp;ndash;
  let's see what it contains now:  
  ```sh
  $ cat code.txt
  ```

---

## *Branches* in Git

- *We now want to improve the code, but these changes are experimental,*  
  and we want to retain our previous version that we know works.
  
- This is where ***branching*** comes in.

  With a new branch, we can make changes that don't affect the `master` branch,
  and we can also keep working on the `master` branch:
  
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="img/csb-branch-intro.png" width="75%"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure modified after Allesino &amp; Wilmes (2019)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

---

## Creating a new branch

- First, we create a new branch as follows:
  ```sh
  $ git branch fastercode   # We name the branch "fastercode"
  ```

- Let's see what our log looks like now, and list the branches:
  ```sh
  $ git log --oneline
  ```
  
  ```sh
  $ git branch  # Without args, git branch will list the branches
  ```

--

- It turns out we created a new branch *but we are still on the master branch*.
  We can **switch branches with `git checkout`**:
  ```sh
  $ git checkout fastercode
  
  $ git branch   # Should now show we are on `fastercode`
  $ git status   # Should also tell us we are on `fastercode`
  ```

---

## Making experimental changes on the new branch

- We edit the code, stage and commit the changes:
  ```sh
  $ echo "Yeah, faster code" &gt;&gt; code.txt
  $ cat code.txt
  $ git add code.txt
  $ git commit -m "Managed to make code faster"
  ```

- Let's check the log again:
  ```sh
  $ git log --oneline # Last commit: on branch "fastercode"
  ```

---

## Moving back to the `master` branch

- We need to switch gears and add references to the paper draft.  
  Since this has nothing to do with our attempt at faster code,  
  we should make these changes **back on the `master` branch**:
  
  ```sh
  $ git checkout master # move back to master
  ```

- What does `code.txt`, which we edited on `fastercode`, now look like?

  ```sh
  $ cat code.txt  # Our working dir contents has changed!!
  ```

- Now, let's add the reference, stage and commit:  
  ```sh
  $ echo "Marra et al. 2014" &gt; references.txt
  $ git add references.txt
  $ git commit -m "Fixed the references"
  ```

--

- Now we've made changes to each of the two branches,
  let's see the log in "graph" format with `--graph`,
  also listing all branches with `--all`:
  ```sh
  $ git log --oneline --graph --all
  ```

---

## Finishing up on the experimental branch

- Earlier, we finished speeding up the code at the `fastercode` branch,
  but we still need to document our changes.
  So, we go back:
  ```sh
  $ git checkout fastercode
  ```

- Do we still have the `references.txt` file from the `master` branch?
  ```sh
  $ ls
  ```
 
- Then, we add the "documentation" to the code, stage and commit:
  ```sh
  $ echo "# My documentation" &gt;&gt; code.txt
  $ git add code.txt
  $ git commit -m "Added comments to the code"
  ```

- Again we check the log graph:  
  ```sh
  $ git log --oneline --all --graph
  ```

---

## Merging the branches

- We are happy with the changes to the code, and want to make the `fastercode`
  version *the default version of the code*.
  
  This means we should merge the `fastercode` branch back into `master`.
  To do so, we first have to move back to `master`:
  ```sh
  $ git checkout master
  ```

- Now we are ready to merge, and we use the `git merge` command.  
  We also provide a commit message, *because a merge is always accompanied
  by a commit*:
  ```sh
  $ git merge fastercode -m "Much faster version of code"
  ```

- Once again, we check the log graph:  
  ```sh
  $ git log --oneline --all --graph
  ```

---

## Cleaning up

- We no longer need the `fastercode` branch, so we can delete it:
  ```sh
  $ git branch -d fastercode
  ```

- And again we check the log graph:
  ```sh
  $ git log --oneline --all --graph
  ```

# Some Git best practices

----

&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

---

## Some Git best practices

- **Write informative commit messages.**  
  Imagine looking back at your project
  in a few months, after finding an error that you introduced a while ago.

  - **Bad:** "Updated file"
  - **Good:** "Updated x function to include y"

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="img/xkcd-git-commit-msg.png" width="70%"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Image source: https://xkcd.com/1296/&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

---

## Some Git best practices

- **Write informative commit messages.**  
  Imagine looking back at your project
  in a few months, after finding an error that you introduced a while ago.

  - **Bad:** "*Updated file*"
  - **Good:** "*Updated x function to include y*"

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-info[
It is often argued that commit messages should preferably be in the form of
completing the sentence "*This commit will...*":

When adhering to this, the above commit message would instead say
"*Update x function to include y*".
]

---

## Some Git best practices (cont.)

- **Commit often, using small commits.**  
  This will also help to keep commit messages informative!

- **Before committing, check what you've changed.**  
  Use `git diff [--staged]` or VS Code functionality.

.content-box-info[
**Avoid including unrelated changes in commits**  
Separate commits if your working dir contains work from disparate edits:
use `git add` + `git commit` separately for two sets of files.
]

--

- **When collaborating: pull often.**  
  This will reduce the chances of *[merge conflicts](#merge-conflict)*.

- **Don't commit unnecessary files.**  
  These can also lead to conflicts &amp;ndash; especially automatically generated,
  temporary files.

---

## Some Git best practices (cont.)

- If you have a repo with general scripts,
  which you continue to develop and use in multiple projects,
  and you publish a paper in which you use these scripts:
  
  Add a "**_tag_**" to a commit to mark the version of the scripts
  used in your analysis.
 
  ```sh
  $ git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Clever release title"
  $ git push --follow-tags # To push all annotated tags to the remote
  ```

A **merge conflict** can occur when all three of the following conditions are met:

- You try to merge two branches
  (including when pulling from remote: recall that a pull includes a merge),
  and:
  
- One or more files have been changed (via commits) on **_both_** of these
  branches since their divergence.
  
- Some of these changes were made in the same part(s) of file(s).

--

&lt;br&gt;

When this occurs, Git has no way of knowing which changes to keep,  
and it will report a merge conflict as follows:

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src=img/merge-conflict-start.png width=90%&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

## *Merge conflicts* and resolving them (cont.)

When you get a merge conflict, follow these steps:

1. Use `git status` to find the conflicting file(s).

&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;

When you get a merge conflict, follow the following steps:

1. Use `git status` to find the conflicting file(s).

2. Open and edit those files manually to a version that fixes the conflict.

.content-box-info[
Git has changed this file to add the conflicting lines from both versions
of the file, and to add marks indicating these conflicting lines:

```sh
On the Origin of Species # Line preceding conflicting line
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD # GIT MARK 1: Next line = current branch
Second line of the book - from main # Conflict line: current branch
======= # GIT MARK 2: Dividing line
Second line of the book - from conflict-branch # Conflict line: incoming branch
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; conflict-branch # GIT MARK 3: Prev line = incoming branch
```

You have to manually change the contents in your text editor to keep the
conflicting content that you want, and to remove the indicator marks that
Git made.

VS Code has some nice functionality to make this easier:

$ code &lt;conflicting-file&gt;  # Open the file in VS Code
```

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src=img/vs-code-merge-conflict.png width=100%&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

If you click on "*Accept Current Change*" or "*Accept Incoming Change*", etc.,
it will keep the desired lines and remove the Git indicator marks.
Then, save and exit.

  ```sh
  $ git commit

  Even if you provided a commit message for the merge at the outset,
  Git will now launch your text editor if you don't again do so.

# Forking and creating a Pull Request

----

&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## Forking a GitHub repository

- Go to a GitHub repository, and click the "**_Fork_**" button in the top-right:
  
  &lt;p align="center"&gt;
  &lt;img src=img/github-fork.png width=50%&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  You'll be asked which account or organization to fork to
  (you should pick your personal account, which is likely the only one you have).

&lt;br&gt;

- Now, you have your own version of the repository,  
  and it is labeled explicitly as a fork:

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src=img/github-forked.png width=55%&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-diy[
You can follow along by e.g. forking
[my `originspecies` repo](https://github.com/jelmerp/originspecies).
]

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## Forking workflow

You can't directly modify the *original repository*, but you can:

- First, **modify your fork** (with local edits and pushing).

- Then, **submit a so-called Pull Request** to the owner of the original repo
  to pull in your changes.
  
- Also, you can also easily **keep your fork up-to-date** with changes to the
  original repository.

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## Editing the forked repository

- Clone your forked GitHub repository to your computer.

  Find the URL for the GitHub repository by clicking the green `Code` button.
  
  Make sure you get the SSH URL, and then click the clipboard button
  next to the URL to copy it.
  
  &lt;p align="center"&gt;
  &lt;img src=img/github-clone.png width=50%&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  
  ```sh
  $ git clone git@github.com:jelmerp/originspecies.git
  ```

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## Editing the forked repository (cont.)

Now, we can make changes to the repository in the familiar way:

  ```sh
  $ echo "# Chapter 1. Variation under domestication" &gt; origin.txt
  
  $ git add origin.txt
  $ git commit -m "Suggested title for first chapter."
  
  $ git push origin
  ```

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## Creating a Pull Request

- If we then go back to GitHub,
  we see that our forked repo is "*x commit(s) ahead*" of the original repo:
  
  &lt;p align="center"&gt;
  &lt;img src=img/github-fork-ahead.png width=100%&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
- Click `Pull Request`, and check whether the right repositories and branches
  are being compared:

  &lt;p align="center"&gt;
  &lt;img src=img/github-pr-compare.png width=100%&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

  You can also see the changes that were made in this window.

- If it looks good, click the green `Create Pull Request` button:
  &lt;p align="center"&gt;
  &lt;img src=img/github-pr.png width=100%&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## Creating a Pull Request (cont.)

- Give your pull request a title,
  and write a brief description of your changes:

  &lt;p align="center"&gt;
  &lt;img src=img/github-pr-confirm.png width=100%&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## Keeping your fork up-to-date

- As we saw, you can't directly *push* to original repo but instead have to submit
  a Pull Request (yes, this terminology is confusing!).
  
  But, you *can* create an ongoing connection to the original repo,
  which you can use to periodically *pull* to keep your fork up-to-date.
  
  This works similarly to connecting your own GitHub repo:
  
```sh
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:jelmerp/originspecies.git

# List the remotes:
$ git remote -v
origin   git@github.com:pallass-boszanger/originspecies.git  (fetch)
origin   git@github.com:pallass-boszanger/originspecies.git  (push)
upstream   git@github.com:jelmerp/originspecies.git  (fetch)
upstream   git@github.com:jelmerp/originspecies.git  (push)

# Pull from the upstream repository:
$ git pull upstream main
```
  
.content-box-info[
"*upstream*" is an arbitrary name often used by convention,  
as opposed to "origin" for your *own* version of the online repo.

background-color: #f2f5eb
name: stash

## `git stash`

Git stash can be useful when you need to pull from remote,
but have changes in your working dir that:
  
  - Are not appropriate for a separate commit
  
  - Are not worth starting a new branch for,
    because you want to get these
    changes back on the current branch immediately.

```sh
# Stash changes to tracked files:
$ git stash    # Note: add option -u to include untracked files

# Pull from the remote repository:
$ git pull

# Apply stashed changes:
$ git stash apply
```

---
background-color: #f2f5eb
name: amend

## Amending commits

Let's say we forgot to add a file to a commit,
or we notice a silly typo in something we just committed.
  
Creating a separate commit for this seems "wasteful" or even confusing,  
and including these changes along with others in a next commit is also likely
to be inappropriate. **In such cases, we can _amend_ the commit**.

- First, we stage the forgotten or fixed file: 
  ```sh
  $ git add &lt;file&gt;
  ```

- Then, we amend the commit (also using the `--no-edit` flag
  because we do not want change the commit message):
  ```sh
  $ git commit --amend --no-edit
  ```

.content-box-warning[
Because amending commits "changes history", some recommend avoiding this
altogether.
For sure, do **not** amend commits that have been published in (*pushed to*)
the online counterpart of the repo.
]

background-color: #f2f5eb
name: tidbits

## More Git tidbits

- Git will not pay attention to *empty* directories.

- You can create a new branch and move to it in one go using:
  ```sh
  $ git checkout -b &lt;new-branch-name&gt;
  ```

- To show commits in which a specific file was changed, you can simply use:
  ```sh
  $ git log &lt;filename&gt;
  ```

- "*Aliases*" (command shortcuts) can be useful with Git,
  and can be added to the `~/.gitconfig` file or set with `git config`:
  ```sh
  [alias]
    hist = log --graph --pretty=format:'%h %ad | %s%d [%an]' --date=short
    last = log -1 HEAD  # Just show the last commit
  ```
  
  ```sh
  $ git config --global alias.last "log -1 HEAD"
  ```
