# Part III: <br> find and xargs

<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

## Two common (?) problems

- Say you try to pipe `ls` output into the imaginary program `process_qc`:

  ```sh
  $ ls *.fq | process_fq
  ```

  Like we've seen before, any spaces in file names would lead to trouble,
  since those file names would be erroneously split into separate arguments.

--

- This problem wouldn't occur with direct globbing:

  ```sh
  $ process_fq *.fq
  ```

  However, a different problem could occur here: if the number of globbed files
  is very high, you can get an error that the "*argument list is too long*".

---

## `find` and `xargs`

**`find` and `xargs` can deal with both of these problems.**

More generally:

- `find` is useful for file searching (and processing) when you need more
  than what `ls` can do and/or are worried about spaces.

- `xargs` is useful for multi-file and parallel processing without loops.

<br> <br>

**Let's create some files to try these commands:**

```sh
$ mkdir -p zmays-snps/{data/seqs,scripts,analysis}

$ touch zmays-snps/data/seqs/zmays{A,B,C}_R{1,2}.fastq
```

---

## `find` basics

- The basic syntax for `find` is:  
  `find [path] [expression-1] [expression-2] ...`.

- `find` will print all files by default, like `ls` &ndash;
  but unlike `ls`, it is recursive by default:
  
  ```sh
  $ find zmays-snps # zmays-snps is the path we are operating on
  #> zmays-snps/
  #> zmays-snps/data
  #> zmays-snps/data/seqs
  #> zmays-snps/data/seqs/zmaysC_R1.fastq
  #> zmays-snps/data/seqs/zmaysA_R1.fastq
  #> zmays-snps/data/seqs/zmaysB_R1.fastq
  #> zmays-snps/data/seqs/zmaysB_R2.fastq
  #> zmays-snps/data/seqs/zmaysC_R2.fastq
  #> zmays-snps/data/seqs/zmaysA_R2.fastq
  #> zmays-snps/scripts
  #> zmays-snps/analysis
  
  $ ls zmays-snps
  #> analysis  data  scripts
  ```

---

## `find` basics

  ```sh
  # Let's move into the zmays-snps dir:
  $ cd zmays-snps
  ```

<br>

- Using the `-name` option, we can also *glob* like we would do with `ls`:

  ```sh
  $ find data/seqs -name "zmaysB*fastq"
  #> data/seqs/zmaysB_R1.fastq
  #> data/seqs/zmaysB_R2.fastq
  ```

---

## `find` functionality beyond that of `ls`

- We can use `-type` as an expression to limit results by file type:

  ```sh
  # "-type f" to only match regular files 
  $ find data/seqs -name "zmaysB*fastq" -type f 
  ```

--

<br>

- In the previous command, the two expressions were implicitly connected with
  a logical *and*: find regular files with "_zmaysB*fastq_" in the name.  
  We could also do this explicitly using the `-and` operator:

  ```sh
  $ find data/seqs -name "zmaysB*fastq" -and -type f 
  ```

- Or we could connect expression with a logical or using the `-or` operator:

  ```sh
  $ find data/seqs -name "zmaysA*fastq" -or -name "zmaysC*fastq" 
  ```

---

## `find` functionality beyond that of `ls`

- We can also negate expressions &ndash; but note that we need to quote the `!`
  so it doesn't get evaluated by the shell:

  ```sh
  # Find regular fies that do NOT match "zmaysC*fastq"
  $ find data/seqs -type f "!" -name "zmaysC*fastq"
  ```
  
- Say we have some files with *temp* in their names that we want to ignore:

  ```sh
  $ touch data/seqs/zmays{A,C}_R{1,2}-temp.fastq
  
  $ find data/seqs -type f "!" -name "zmaysC*fastq" \
        -and "!" -name "*-temp*"
  ```

<br>

--

.content-box-info[
But what does a `!` mean to the shell? It accesses past commands:
```sh
# To re-execute your most recent command:
$ !!
```
]

---

## Running commands on `find`'s results

- Now, we want to remove these temporary files,
  which we can do using `-exec` followed by our `rm` command
  (using `rm -i` for interactive removal): 

  ```sh
  $ find data/seqs -name "*-temp.fastq" -exec rm -i {} \;
  ```

  Here, `{}` is the placeholder for the file names we are passing on,
  and we have to indicate the end of our command with an escaped semicolon: `\;`.

- `-exec` can be very useful to *process file queries* that are more
  complicated than what a simple globbing pattern allows for.

--

.content-box-info[
With `-exec`, you can use any command to operate on the files that you found. 

But as it happens, because it is such a common operation to remove files found
with `find`, there is a `-delete` shortcut for this:

```sh
find zmays-snps/data/seqs -name "*-temp.fastq" -delete
```
]

---

## `xargs`

- `xargs` is to be read/pronounced as `x-args`, where "*args*" means "*arguments*".

  This function passes arguments, supplied via standard in, on to another command.
  For example:
  
  ```sh
  $ find data/seqs -name "*-temp.fastq" | xargs rm
  ```

- This is equivalent to the following, where `rm` receives the very same list
  of files as its arguments:

  ```sh
  $ rm data/seqs/*-temp.fastq
  ```

--

- However, now, we can bypass the *maximum number of arguments* to `rm`,
  because we can easily pass one argument at a time with `-n 1`:

  ```sh
  $ find data/seqs -name "*-temp.fastq" | xargs -n 1 rm
  ```

  This command runs `rm` as many times as there are _"*-temp.fastq"_ files.


---

## `xargs`

By using `xargs` instead of `find -exec`, we separate the process that finds
the files we want to operate on, from the actual operations.

This can be beneficial, for instance if we want to carefully inspect a list
of files before we do anything:

```sh
$ touch data/seqs/zmays{A,C}_R{1,2}-temp.fastq

# We save the find results in a text file
$ find data/seqs -name "*-temp.fastq" > files-to-delete.txt
$ cat files-to-delete.txt
#> data/seqs/zmaysC_R1-temp.fastq
#> data/seqs/zmaysA_R1-temp.fastq
#> data/seqs/zmaysA_R2-temp.fastq
#> data/seqs/zmaysC_R2-temp.fastq

# Now we pass that list of files to rm:
$ cat files-to-delete.txt | xargs rm
```

---

## Using `xargs` with replacement strings

- We can also specify where we want to insert the arguments that are being passed
  on, as is often necessary:

  ```sh
  $ find data/seqs -name "*.fastq" | \
        xargs basename -s ".fastq" | \
        xargs -I{} fastq_stat --in {}.fastq --out results/{}.txt 
  ```

  Above, we use `-I{}` to specify that the arguments will be passed on with the
  placeholder `{}`. As you can see, we are also able to use `{}` multiple times. 

--

- This functionality is similar to what you may be inclined to do in a loop
  instead &ndash; the above is equivalent to:

  ```sh
  $ for $fastq_file in data/seqs/*fastq; do
          fastq_short=$(basename $fastq_file .fastq)
          fastq_stat --in $fastq_file --out results/$fastq_short.txt
      done
  ```
  
---

## `xargs` and parallelization

One advantage of using `xargs` instead of a `for` loop is that we have control
over parallelization.

- To parallelize, i.e. to spawn multiple simultaneous process,
  we can send each process to the background in the `for` loop using `&`:

  ```sh
  $ for $fastq_file in *fastq; do
        fastq_short=$(basename $fastq_file .fastq) 
        fastq_stat --in $fastq_file --out results/$fastq_short.txt &
    done
  ```

  However, this would spawn exactly as many processes as there are input files,
  which could be way more than what we want.

--

- With `xargs`, we can control the number of simultaneous processes that
  are spawned using `-P` (here set to 6):

  ```sh
    $ find data/seqs -name "*.fastq" | \
          xargs basename -s ".fastq" | \
          xargs -P 6 -I{} fastq_stat --in {}.fastq --out results/{}.txt 
  ```

---

## `xargs` and spaces in file names

As always, spaces in file names can trip you, but you were promised a solution
with `find` and `xargs`.

- But out of the box, this does in fact fail:

  ```sh
  $ touch "samples A.txt"  "samples B.txt" 
  
  $ find . -name "samples [AB].txt" | xargs rm
  #> rm: cannot remove './samples': No such file or directory
  #> rm: cannot remove 'A.txt': No such file or directory
  #> rm: cannot remove './samples': No such file or directory
  #> rm: cannot remove 'B.txt': No such file or directory
  ```

- The solution is to use `-print0` with `find`, so it prints files with a
  "null byte" as the delimiter.
  Then, we also need to tell `xargs` about this, using `-0`:

  ```sh
  $ find . -name "samples [AB].txt" -print0 | xargs -0 rm -v
  #> removed './samples A.txt'
  #> removed './samples B.txt'
  ```


---

## More parallelization

.content-box-info[
If you like the `xargs` approach to running multiple processes,
you may also be interested in the `parallel` command,
which is even more powerful than `xargs`.

I personally don't do this very much because I tend to submit separate batch jobs
for each file, which can easily be done with simple `for` loops.
