## Side note: Standard out and standard error

- When commands run into errors, they will print error messages.  
  
  Error messages are **not** part of standard out,   
  and instead represent a separate output stream: **"standard error"**.

--

- We can see this when we try to list a non-existing directory,
  redirect to a file, but the error is instead printed to screen: 
  ```sh
  $ ls -lhr solutions/ > solution_files.txt 
  #> ls: cannot access solutions.txt: No such file or directory
  ```

--

- What about the file we tried to write to, does it contain anything?

  ```sh
  $ ls
  #> solution_files.txt
  $ cat solution_files.txt
  $                # We just get our prompt back - file is empty
  ```

--

.content-box-info[
Standard output is often abbreviated as *stdout* and standard error is often
abbreviated as *stderr*.
]

---

## Standard out and standard error (cont.)

- So, without redirection **(a)** versus with **`>`** redirection **(b)**:
<p align="left">
<img src=img/std-streams.png width="550">
</p>

--

- But we *can* also redirect the standard error using `2>`:

  ```sh
  # Redirect stdout (>) and stderr (2>) to separate files:
  ls -lhr solutions/ > solution_files.txt 2> errors.txt
  ```

- Or combine *stdout* and *stderr* streams into a single output file with `&>`:

  ```sh
  $ ls -lhr solutions/ &> out.txt
  ```

## More on SLURM directives

**We saw the following directives earlier:**  
  
| Resource/use                  | short      | long                 | default
|-------------------------------|------------|----------------------|:---------:|
| Project to be billed          | -A PAS0471 | --account=PAS0471    | _N/A_
| Time limit                    | -t 4:00:00 | --time=4:00:00       | ?
| Nr of nodes                   | -N 1       | --nodes=1            | 1
| Nr of cores                   | -c 1       | --cpus-per-task=1    | 1
| Nr of "tasks" (processes)     | -n 1       | --ntasks=1           | 1
| Nr of tasks per node          | -          | --ntasks-per-node    | 1
| Memory limit per node         | -          | --mem=4G             | *(single-core value)*

---

## More on SLURM directives (cont.)

**Some other options (for more, see the [SLURM documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html)):**

| Resource/use                         | short    | long
|--------------------------------------|----------|-------
| Log output file (%j = job number)    | -o       |  --output=slurm-fastqc-%j.out
| Error output (*stderr*)              | -e       | --error=slurm-fastqc-%j.err
| Job name (displayed in the queue)    | -        | --job-name=fastqc
| Partition/queue                      | -        | --partition=longserial
| Get email when job starts/ends/fails | -        | --mail-type=ALL/START/END/FAIL
| Let job begin at/after specific time | -        | --begin=2021-02-01T12:00:00
| Let job begin after other jobs is done | -      | --dependency=afterany:123456

.content-box-info[
By default, standard output **and** standard error are sent to the
same output file (`-o` / `--output`).
To send standard error to its own output file, use the `-e` / `--error` option.
]

---

## More on SLURM directives (cont.)

In scripts, SLURM directives must be provided before any executable lines:

.pull-left[
**Good:**

```sh
#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --account=PAS18655

set -e -u -o pipefail
```
]

.pull-left[
**Bad:**

```sh
#!/bin/bash

set -e -u -o pipefail

#SBATCH --account=PAS18655
```
]

---

## SLURM environment variables

| Variable            | Description
|---------------------|------------
| `$SLURM_SUBMIT_DIR` | Path to dir from which job was started
| `$TMPDIR`           | Path to dir for job (fast I/O)
| `$SLURM_JOB_ID`     | Job ID assigned by SLURM
| `$SLURM_JOB_NAME`   | Job name supplied by the user

# An example: <br> Submitting a script to run FastQC to SLURM

----

<br> <br> <br> <br>

---

## FastQC: A program for quality control of fastq files 

FastQC produces visualizations and assessments of fastq files for statistics
such as per-base quality (below) and adapter content.

.pull-left[
<p align="center">
<img src=img/fastqc_good.png width="80%">
</p>
]

.pull-right[
<p align="center">
<img src=img/fastqc_bad.png width="80%">
</p>
]

--

- FastQC analyzes **one fastq file at a time**
  (which can be gzipped: `fastq.gz`),
  and outputs a nice HTML file with its results.
  
  Running it is straightforward:
  ```sh
  $ fastqc --outdir=<output-dir> <fastq-file>
  ```

---

## Our basic FastQC script

Here is what a script to run FastQC non-interactively could look like:
  
```sh
#!/bin/bash
set -e -u -o pipefail

fastq_file="$1"
output_dir="$2" 

mkdir -p "$output_dir"

echo "Running fastqc for file: $fastq_file"
echo "Output dir: $output_dir"

fastqc --outdir="$output_dir" "$fastq_file"
```

--

<br>

**To run this at OSC, we need to do two additional things:**

1. Add SLURM directives to request the appropriate cluster resources.

1.  Load OSC's module for FastqQC.
  
---

## Adding SLURM directives to our FastQC script

In this case, we're happy with most of the defaults, which include 1 node
and 1 core, so we only specify the following options:

- The job should be billed to the `PAS1855` project
  (recall that we always need to provide the project number):
  ```sh
  #SBATCH --account=PAS1855
  ```

--

- FastQC does not take long to run, so we can use a time limit of 15 minutes:
  ```sh
  #SBATCH --time=15
  ```

---

## Adding SLURM directives to our FastQC script

- We add "*fastqc*" to the default output file name for the log,
  which would be `slurm-<job-number>.out`.
  This is useful to keep track of what your different log files are about.
  
  `%j` is the job number which is printed by default, but not if we specify
  out output as, say `slurm-fastqc.out`. By including this, we will avoid
  have multiple jobs that produce the same log file.
  
  ```sh
  #SBATCH --output=slurm-fastqc-%j.out
  ```

--

  .content-box-info[
  Other useful patterns include `%u` (user name) and `%x` (job name).
  ]

---

## Loading the module

To be able to run FastQC at OSC, we need to load the module, which we can
simply do by adding the following line in the script:

```sh
module load fastqc/0.11.8
```

This line needs to occur before we call FastQC,
and it's best placed at the start of the script.

---

## The full script

```sh
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=PAS0471
#SBATCH --time=60
#SBATCH --output=slurm-fastqc-%j.out
set -e -u -o pipefail

module load fastqc/0.11.8

fastq_file="$1"
output_dir="$2" 

mkdir -p "$output_dir"

echo "Running fastqc for file: $fastq_file"
echo "Output dir: $output_dir"

fastqc --outdir="$output_dir" "$fastq_file"
```

---

## The full script &ndash; touched up a bit more

```sh
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --account=PAS0471
#SBATCH --time=15
#SBATCH --output=slurm-fastqc-%j.out
set -e -u -o pipefail

module load fastqc/0.11.8

fastq_file="$1"
output_dir="$2" 

mkdir -p "$output_dir"

date                              # Report date+time to time script
echo "Starting FastQC script..."  # Report what script is being run
echo "Running fastqc for file: $fastq_file"
echo "Output dir: $output_dir"
echo -e "---------\n\n"           # Separate from program output

fastqc --outdir="$output_dir" "$fastq_file"

echo -e "\n---------\nAll done!"  # Separate from program output
date                              # Report date+time to time script
```

---

## Submit the job

- Before submitting to SLURM, we need to make the script executable:

  ```sh
  $ chmod u+x scripts/fastqc_single.sh
  ```

<br>

--

- We need to provide the script with an output dir and a FASTQ file,   
  whose names we will store in variables:
  
  ```sh
  $ output_dir=analysis/QC_fastq
  $ fastq_file=/fs/ess/PAS1855/data/fastq_16S/201-S4-V4-V5_S53_L001_R1_001.fastq
  ```

- Now we can submit the job:

  ```sh
  $ sbatch scripts/fastqc_single.sh "$fastq_file" "$output_dir"
  # Submitted batch job 2451088
  ```

---

## Monitoring the SLURM job

We can check what's happening with the job using the SLURM command `squeue`:

- Initially the job may be queued &ndash; `PD` in the `ST` (**st**atus) column:

  ```sh
  squeue -u $USER
  # JOBID   PARTITION     NAME       USER    ST      TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)
  # 2526085 serial-40     fastqc_s   jelmer  PD       0:00      1 (None) 
  ```

--

- Then the job should be running &ndash; `R` in the `ST` column:

  ```sh
  squeue -u $USER
  # JOBID   PARTITION     NAME       USER    ST      TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON) 
  # 2526085 serial-40     fastqc_s   jelmer  R       0:02      1 p0002 
  ```

--

- When the job has finished, `squeue` will return nothing (!):

  ```sh
  squeue -u $USER
  # JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON) 
  ```

---

## Check the log and the output files

- Let's look for *SLURM* log files: 

  ```sh
  $ ls
  # slurm-fastqc-2451088.out
  ```

--

- Let's look at the contents of the log file:

  ```sh
  $ less slurm-fastqc-2451088.out
  ```

--

- Let's check the output dir:

  ```sh
  $ ls -lh $output_dir
  ```

--

- Finally, we keep things organized and move the log file to a log dir:

  ```sh
  $ mkdir -p logs/
  $ mv slurm* logs
  ```

---

## Now loop over all files...

The script that we wrote above will run FastQC for a single FASTQ file.  

**Next, we can write a second script that loops over many files and submits the
script for each of them.**

In this case, we will do so by simply looping over all FASTQ files in a
specified directory:

```sh
$ for fastq_file in "$fastqc_dir"/*fastq; do
      scripts/qc/fastqc_single.sh "$fastq_file" "$output_dir" 
  done
```

---

## The full script to loop over a directory

Script `fastqc_dir.sh`:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
set -e -u -o pipefail

fastq_dir="$1"
output_dir="$2" 

echo "Submitting FastQC jobs..."
echo "Input dir: $fastq_dir"
echo "Output dir: $output_dir"
echo "Number of files: $(ls $fastq_dir/*fastq | wc -l)"

for fastq_file in "$fastqc_dir"/*fastq.gz; do
    scripts/qc/fastqc_single.sh "$fastq_file" "$output_dir" 
done

echo -e "\n---------\nAll done!" 
```

---

## Run the loop script

- Make sure the script is executable:
  ```sh
  $ chmod u+x scripts/*
  ```

- Run the script:
  ```sh
  $ fastq_dir=fastq/
  $ output_dir=analysis/QC_fastq/
  $ scripts/fastqc_dir.sh "$fastq_dir" "$output_dir"
  #> echo "Submitting FastQC jobs..."
  #> echo "Input dir: fastq/"
  #> echo "Output dir: analysis/QC_fastq/"
  #> echo "Number of files: 8"
  #> Submitted batch job 2452187
  #> Submitted batch job 2452188
  #> Submitted batch job 2452189
  #> ...
  ```

.content-box-info[
We didn't need to submit *this* script to the queue:
all it does is submit jobs, which can be done just fine on a login node.
]

---

## Monitor the loop script

- Check the queue:
  ```sh
  $ squeue -u $USER
  ```

- Peak at all the log files:
  ```sh
  $ tail slurm-fastqc*
  
  $ less slurm-fastqc*  # Press ":n" to go the next file
  ```

<br>

.content-box-info[
We could also "follow" the output in a log file as it's being added to the file:

```sh
tail -f <file>
```
]

# Example II: Running MultiQC with conda

----

<br> <br> <br> <br>

---

## MultiQC

MultiQC is a program that *summarizes multiple FastQC results*  
into a single nicely formatted HTML page:

<br>

----

<p align="center">
<img src=img/multiqc_front.png width="100%">
</p>

---

## MultiQC

- For instance, this figure shows mean quality scores across 132 samples:

<p align="center">
<img src=img/multiqc_qual.png width="100%">
</p>

---

## MultiQC and Conda at OSC

- Like FastQC, running MultiQC is straightforward:

  ```sh
  # This will put the MultiQC report in the working dir:
  $ multiqc <dir-with-fastqc-reports>
  
  # You can also specify the output dir for the MultiQC report: 
  $ multiqc <dir-with-fastqc-reports> -o <output-dir>
  ```

--

- But, MultiQC is *not* available as a module at OSC (i.e., no `module load`).
  Therefore, we will install it for ourselves with Conda.

---

## Conda at OSC

- To use Conda at OSC, we first need to load the module (every session!):

  ```sh
  $ module load python/3.6-conda5.2
  ```
  
- We will also do some one-time configuration,
  to set the Conda "channels" (repositories) and their priorities:

  ```sh
  $ conda config --add channels defaults
  $ conda config --add channels bioconda
  $ conda config --add channels conda-forge  # Highest priority
  ```
  
---

## One-time installation of MultiQC <br> into a Conda environment

- Now, we are ready to create a new Conda environment,  
  and install MultiQC into it:
 
  ```sh
  $ conda create -y -n multiqc-env -c bioconda multiqc
  ```

  - `create` is the Conda sub-command to create a new environment.
  
  - `-y` avoids a confirmation prompt.
  
  - `-n multiqc-env` is an arbitrary name for the new environment.
  
  - `-c bioconda` is the Conda "channel" we download from (overriding our
    defaults which seems necessary in this case).
  
  - `multiqc` is the name of the package.

---

## Running MultiQC from now on

- Whenever you want to use a Conda environment at OSC,
  you need to first load the module, and then *activate* the Conda environment
  that you want:

  ```sh
  $ module load python/3.6-conda5.2
  $ source activate multiqc-env
  ```

- Having done that, you should be able to run MultiQC:

  ```sh
  $ multiqc --help
  ```

<br>

.content-box-info[
If you didn't manage to create your own conda environment,  
you can also use mine:

```sh
$ source activate /users/PAS0471/jelmer/.conda/envs/multiqc
```
]

---

## Running MultiQC in an interactive job

Because MultiQC also runs quickly and only needs to be run once for all of
our files, we will run it in an interactive job.

To start an interactive job and run MultiQC there:

```sh
# Start an interactive job at OSC:
$ sinteractive -A PAS0471 # No time specified: will be 30 minutes

$ module load python/3.6-conda5.2
$ source activate multiqc-env

$ multiqc results/QC_fastq/ -o results/QC_fastq/
```

---

## More Conda

- Export a text file with the environment description:

```sh
# Active environment:
$ conda env export > environment.yml

# Any environment:
$ conda env export -n multiqc > environment.yml
```

<br>

.content-box-info[
Some other Conda commands:

```sh
$ conda install multiqc # Install into active environment
$ conda env list     # List your conda environments
$ conda deactivate   # Deactivate active conda environment
$ conda env remove -n mynewenv # Remove an env. entirely
```

## Side note: Modules and portability

- Here, we have loaded OSC's `fastqc` module:
  ```sh

## More options to monitor and manage SLURM jobs

- Check using job ID:

  ```sh
  $ squeue -j 123456
  $ squeue -j 123456 -l # TEST THIS
  ```

- Filter by status:

  ```sh
  $ squeue -u usr1234 -t RUNNING
  ```

- Update SLURM directives for a submitted job:

  ```sh
  $ scontrol update job=123456 timeLimit=5:00:00 mailType=End # TEST
  #https://slurm.schedmd.com/scontrol.html
  ```

- To see script #CHECK

  ```sh
  jobscript 14177
  ```

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## More options to monitor and manage SLURM jobs

- Hold and release a job, e.g. when needing to update input file:

  ```sh
  $ scontrol hold 123456
  $ scontrol release 123456
  ```

- You can *cancel* jobs using `scancel`:
  
  ```sh
  $ scancel <jobID>
  $ scancel -u $USER
  ```

- Also stats: #CHECK

  ```sh
  $ sstat -j <jobid>
  ```

- You can get a list of the nodes and cores assigned to your job using:

  ```sh
  srun hostname | sort -n
  ```

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## More options to monitor and manage SLURM jobs

- You can see more details about any job, including finished jobs,
  using `scontrol show job`:
  
  ```sh
  scontrol show job 2526085   # Replace the number with your JOBID

  # UserId=jelmer(33227) GroupId=PAS0471(3773) MCS_label=N/A

  # Partition=serial-40core AllocNode:Sid=pitzer-login01:57954
  # [...]
  ```

- To get this information for every job you run, you can include this at
  the end of your script:
  
  ```sh
  scontrol show job $SLURM_JOB_ID
  ```

---
background-color: #ededed

## time

The `time` utility is used to measure the performance of a single command.

It can be used for serial or parallel processes.
Add `/usr/bin/time` to the beginning of a command in the batch script:

```sh
/usr/bin/time myprog arg1 arg2
```

The result is provided in the following format:

1. user time (CPU time spent running your program)
1. system time (CPU time spent by your program in system calls)
1. elapsed time (wallclock)
1. % CPU used
1. memory, pagefault and swap statistics
1. I/O statistics

These results are appended to the job's error log file.
Note: Use the full path `/usr/bin/time` to get all the information shown.

# Bash configuration files and $PATH

----

<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## Bash configuration files

Your bash shell is configured using simple (hidden) text files in your `$HOME`:

- `~/.bashrc` &ndash; for non-login shells

- `~/.bash_profile` &ndash; for non-login shells

These can be viewed and edited like normal text files:

```sh
$ cat ~/.bashrc

$ nano ~/.bashrc    # Or open in VS Code
```

--

.content-box-info[
**Some of the settings that are / can be stored in these config files:**

- The look of your prompt.

- `alias`es &ndash; personal, custom shortcuts for (complex) commands.

- The `$PATH`, a list of directories with binaries (next slide).

- Other custom settings like running setup scripts.
]

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## Bash configuration files

Your bash shell is configured using simple (hidden) text files in your `$HOME`:

- `~/.bashrc` &ndash; for non-login shells

- `~/.bash_profile` &ndash; for non-login shells

These can be viewed and edited like normal text files:

```sh
$ cat ~/.bashrc

$ nano ~/.bashrc    # Or open in VS Code
```

<br>

.content-box-info[
To not have to deal with the login/non-login shell distinction, it is common
to put all settings in one of these files (often `.bashrc`) and let the second
file (often `.bash_profile`) run the first file whenever it itself is being run.
]

background-color: #f2f5eb

## `$PATH`: A list of directories with binaries

- `$PATH` is another environment variable like `$HOME` and `$USER`.

- It lists the directories that will be searched when you type a program’s name.
  This allows you to run programs without specifying the full path to the executable.
  For example:
  
  ```sh
  $ vcftools
  #> VCFtools (0.1.16)
  #> (c) Adam Auton and Anthony Marcketta 2009
  
  # To check where the program's binary is located:
  $ which vcftools
  #> /usr/bin/vcftools
  ```

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## `$PATH`: A list of directories with binaries (cont.)

- To check which directories are in your `$PATH`, you can simply `echo` it:

  ```sh
  $ echo $PATH
  #> /apps/xalt/xalt/bin:/opt/mvapich2/intel/19.0/2.3.3/bin:/apps/gnu/8.4.0/bin:/opt/intel/19.0.5/itac_latest/bin:/opt/intel/19.0.5/advisor/bin64:/opt/intel/19.0.5/vtune_amplifier/bin64:/opt/intel/19.0.5/inspector_2019/bin64:/opt/intel/19.0.5/compilers_and_libraries_2019/linux/bin/intel64:/apps/software_usage:/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/opt/osc/bin:/opt/moab/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/opt/ibutils/bin:/opt/ddn/ime/bin:/opt/puppetlabs/bin:/users/PAS0471/jelmer/software/bin

- The output looks strange and is hard to read because the different directories
  in your `$PATH` are separated by colons `:`.
  Let's make that a bit more readable:
  
  ```sh
  $ echo $PATH | tr ":" "\n" | nl
  #> 1  /apps/xalt/xalt/bin
  #> 2  /opt/mvapich2/intel/19.0/2.3.3/bin
  #> 3  /apps/gnu/8.4.0/bin
  #> 4  /opt/intel/19.0.5/itac_latest/bin
  #> 5  /opt/intel/19.0.5/advisor/bin64
  #> ...
  ```

## `$PATH`: A list of directories with binaries (cont.)

- You can easily modify your `$PATH`.
  To add a directory to your `$PATH` in the current session,
  you simply *append* a new dir after a colon:

  ```sh
  $ PATH=$PATH:~/new-dir-with-software/
  ```

<br>

--

- However, this change will not have any effects outside of your current bash sessions.
  
  **For lasting changes**,
  you should edit your bash configuration files (like `~/.bashrc`),
  from which `$PATH` is loaded whenever you open a terminal:
  
  ```sh
  $ echo "PATH=$PATH:~/new-dir-with-software/" >> ~/.bashrc
  ```

## One-time Conda setup <br> to enable `conda activate`

- In contrast to `source activate`,
  `conda activate` can only be used after a setup script is run.
  
  These commands do the same thing, though Conda documentation nowadays
  recommends to use `conda activate`. Should you want to do so,
  follow these instructions.

<br>

- The setup script needs to run in every session, but we can *add code to our bash
  configuration file* that will make sure the the setup script is run whenever
  we log in at OSC.
  
  This is unfortunately made more complicated because the two OSC cluster,
  Owens and Pitzer, have Conda installed in different locations.

## One-time Conda setup <br> to enable `conda activate`

- The following lines should be added to your `~/.bashrc`:

  ```sh
  if [ -f /apps/python/3.6-conda5.2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh ]; then
        source /apps/python/3.6-conda5.2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
  elif [ -f /usr/local/python/3.6-conda5.2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh ]; then
        source /usr/local/python/3.6-conda5.2/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
  fi
  ```

## One-time Conda setup (cont.)

- The `~/.bashrc` config file is run whenever we open a new shell,
  but we also need to run the setup script now.
  
  To do so, we will *source* the edited bash config file:

  ```sh
  $ source ~/.bashrc
  ```

  .content-box-info[
  The above  `~/.bashrc` setup only needs to be run once &ndash;
  it does not need to be repeated every session.
