## The need for "formal" workflow management

> The essence of what we're trying to do:
>
> - Automate a workflow
> - Document the workflow
> - Document the dependencies among data files, code
> - Re-run only the necessary code, based on what has changed
> [Karl Broman](http://kbroman.org/Tools4RR/assets/lectures/01_intro.pdf)

> Typically, researchers codify workflows using general scripting languages such as Python or Bash. But these often lack the necessary flexibility. Workflows can involve hundreds to thousands of data files; a pipeline must be able to monitor their progress and exit gracefully if any step fails. And pipelines must be smart enough to work out which tasks need to be re-executed and which do not.

> Bioinformatician Davis McCarthy at St Vincentâ€™s Institute of Medical Research in Fitzroy, Australia, says Python and R were more than enough for the relatively simple workflows he used as a PhD student.
