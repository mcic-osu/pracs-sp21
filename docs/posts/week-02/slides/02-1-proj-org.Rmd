## Importance of good project organization

<br>

**Good project organization and documentation facilitates:**

- Collaborating with others (and yourself in the future...)

- Reproducibility

- Automation

- Version control

<br>

In short, it is a necessary foundation to use this course's tools and  
to reach some of its goals.

---

## Project organization &ndash; some underlying principles

- **One dir hierarchy for one project** &mdash; in other words:

  - Don't keep multiple distinct projects inside one dir.

  - Don't keep files for one project in multiple places.

<br>

--

- Within the dir hierarchy:

  - **Separate code from data**

  - **Separate raw data from processed data**

<br>

--

- **Treat raw data as read-only** (and treat generated output as disposable).

- **Use good dir and file naming**.

- **Slow down and document.**

---

## One dir hierarchy for one project

When you have a single directory hierarchy for each project, it is:

- Easier to: find files, share your project,
  not throw away stuff in error, ...

- Possible to use *relative paths* within a project's scripts => more portable.

## One dir hierarchy for one project (cont.)


### Absolute versus relative path recap:

- **Absolute paths** start from the root directory,
  break when moving a project, and don't generally work across computers.


- **Relative paths** start from a *working dir*: when you always use the root of
  the *project* as the working dir, paths work when moving the project within
  and between computers.

## One dir hierarchy for one project (cont.)

### But how to define and separate projects?

From [Wilson et al 2017 - Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510):

> *As a rule of thumb, divide work into projects based on the overlap in data and*
> *code files.*
>
> *If 2 research efforts share no data or code,*
> *they will probably be easiest to manage independently.*  
>
> *If they share more than half of their data and code, they are probably best*
> *managed together.*

> *If you are building tools that are used in several projects,*
> *the common code should probably be in a project of its own.*

---

## Projects with shared data or code

- To access files outside of the project (e.g., shared across projects),  
  it is easiest to create **links** to these files:

<p align="center">
<img src=img/proj-dirs-4.svg width=60%>
</p>


---

## Projects with shared data or code (cont.)

- But shared data or scripts are generally better stored in separate dirs,  
  and then linked to by each project using them:
  
<p align="center">
<img src=img/proj-dirs-5.svg width=60%>
</p>

--

.content-box-warning[
These strategies do decrease the portability of your project,  
and moving the shared files even within your own computer  
will cause links to break.
]

---

## Projects with shared data or code (cont.)

A more portable method is to *keep shared (multi-project) files online* &ndash;  
this is especially feasible for **scripts** under version control:  

<p align="center">
<img src=img/proj-dirs-6.svg width=70%>
</p>

--

.content-box-info[
For **data**, this is also possible but often not practical due to file sizes. It's easier after data has been deposited in a public repository.

.pull-right[
**Several things depend on preferences and project specifics:**
- `data` as single top-level dir?  

- `results` vs `analysis` (Buffalo)

- `src` (source) vs `scripts` vs `workflow`

- Where to put figures &ndash; `results/plots/qc` or `results/qc/plots/`?
]

--

.content-box-info[
**Other best practices:**

- Use subdirectories liberally (e.g. within `analysis`, `scripts`).
  
- Also add *READMEs* within dirs.
]

---

## File naming

**Three principles for good file names**
([Jenny Bryan](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files)):

- Machine-readable

- Human-readable

- Playing well with default ordering

---

## File naming: Machine-readable

Consistent and informative naming helps to *programmatically find  
and process files.*

- In file names, provide **metadata** like Sample ID, date, and treatment:
  
  - `sample032_2016-05-03_low.txt`  
  
  - `samples_soil_treatmentA_2019-01.txt`

- Now, you can use **globbing** to select samples from a certain month or
  treatment (*more about this on Thursday*):
  ```sh
  $ ls *2016-05*
  
  $ ls *treatmentA*
  ```

--

.content-box-info[
*Suffices*, like `.txt`, `.md`, and `.csv` are generally not necessary
in Unix, but are still useful to distinguish file types easily and programmatically.
]

---

## File naming: Machine-readable (cont.)

- Spaces in file names lead to inconvenience or trouble:
  
  ```sh
  $ mkdir "raw sequences"
  $ mkdir sequences
  
  $ rm -rf raw sequences
  ```

- More generally, only use the following in file names:
  - Alphanumeric characters <kbd>A-Za-z0-9</kbd>
  - Underscores <kbd>_</kbd>
  - Hyphens (dashes) <kbd>-</kbd>
  - Periods (dots) <kbd>.</kbd>
  
---

## File naming: Human-readable

> *"Name all files to reflect their content or function.*
> *For example, use names such as bird_count_table.csv, manuscript.md,*
> *or sightings_analysis.py.*"  
> [Wilson et al. 2017](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510)
  
---

## File naming: Combining machine- and human-readable

- *One* good way (opinionated recommendations):
  
  - Use **underscores <kbd>_</kbd> to delimit units** you may later want to
    separate on (extract with `cut`, etc.): sampleID, batch, treatment, date.
  
  - Within such units, use **dashes <kbd>-</kbd> to delimit words**:
    `grass-samples`.
  
  - Limit the use of **periods <kbd>.</kbd> to indicate file extensions**.
  
  - (Generally *avoid capitals*.)

<br>

- For example:
  ```sh
  mmus001_treatmentA_filtered-mq30-only_sorted_dedupped.bam
  mmus002_treatmentA_filtered-mq30-only_sorted_dedupped.bam
  .
  .
  .
  mmus086_treatmentG_filtered-mq30-only_sorted_dedupped.bam
  ```

  
---

## File naming: Ordering

- Use **leading zeros** for lexicographic sorting: `sample005`.

- **Dates** should always be written as `YYYY-MM-DD`: `2020-10-11`.

- Can **group similar files together** by starting with same phrase,  
  and **number scripts** according to their execution order:
  ```sh
  DE-01_normalize.R
  DE-02_test.R
  DE-03_process-significant.R
  ```

---

## Slow down and document

**Use README files to document:**
  
- Your methods
  
- Where/when/how each data and metadata file originated
  
- Versions of software, databases, reference genomes
  
- *...Everything needed to rerun whole project*

<br>

---

## Slow down and document &ndash; Use plain text files

**Plain text files offer several benefits over proprietary & binary formats**
(like `.docx` and `.xlsx`):

- Can be accessed on any computer, including over remote connections

- Are future-proof

- Allow to be version-controlled

<br>

.content-box-answer[
These considerations apply not just to files for documentation,  
but also to data files, etc!

## Bonus: Managing software

- Keep track of the versions of software that you use!

- At OSC, load modules *with* a version specification --
  otherwise, you may not know what you used,
  and default versions changes can go unnoticed.
  
  ```sh
  # Load default -- you can bet this will be a different one in a year or two
  module load R 
  
  # Preferred:
  module load R/4.0.2
  ```
  
- `conda` environments can be useful too,
  e.g. for maintaining multiple versions of the same software,
  or being able to run mutually incompatible software.

We'll talk more about this in the OSC (Week 6) and Snakemake (Week 12) modules.
