## Markdown Syntax

- Note line break behavior and leading spaces
  - Similarly, a single blank line versus multiple will look the same.

- Horizontal line

- Table syntax

- HTML: <br>

---

## Markdown in VS Code

---

## HTML in Markdown

- `<br>` to force a line break or extra space between items 

- Useful for figures

- Useful to color words

---

## Optional install: Pandoc

- To *render* a Markdown file into e.g. HTML or PDF, use `Pandoc`:

```sh
pandoc README.md > README.html
pandoc -o README.pdf README.md
```

- For installation (all OS's), see <https://pandoc.org/installing.html>.

---

## Markdown for everything?!

- These slides have been written in Markdown

- Our Github course website has been written in Markdown

- Markdown documents can also contain code that *runs*!
  
  - R Markdown
  
  - Jupyter Notebooks

## VS Code: A Quick Tour

---

## VS Code: Misc.

- For parentheses `()`, brackets `{}` `[]`, etc:
  - Typing an *opening* character will immediately get you a closing one
  - Selecting text and then pressing and opening parentheses will place entire selection
    between parentheses, etc.
  - Multiple cursors

- Open a file in VS code from the shell using `code <file>`

- Color theme I like: `Quiet Light`

---

## VS Code: Keyboard Shortcuts

**Add a shortcut to run shell commands from editor:**

- Gear icon `r icon::fa("cog")` in bottom-left > "`Keyboard Shortcuts`".

- Find "`Terminal: Run Selected Text in Active Terminal`",  
  then add a shortcut, e.g. `Ctrl + Enter`.

<br>

Especially useful shortcuts:

- `Ctrl` + `backtick` and `Ctrl` + `1`: toggle between terminal and editor.

- `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `K` to delete a line
  ("Delete Line" &ndash; change to `Ctrl` + `D`?) 

<br>

Some browser-like shortcuts:
  
- Ctrl + PgDn/PgUp to toggle editor tabs,

- `Ctrl + W` to close a tab

- `Ctrl + Shift + T` to reopen the last tab.

---

## VS Code: Extensions

- Click the gear icon `r icon::fa("cog")` and then `Extensions`,
  and search for:
  
  - "**Python**" (by Microsoft)
  
  - "**Rainbow CSV**" (by *mechatroner*)

  - *If you're (also) working locally:*
  
      - "**Remote Development**" (Microsoft)
  
  - *If you want fancier Markdown previews/options:*
  
      - "**Markdown Preview Enhanced**" (Yiyi Wang)
    
      - "**Markdown TOC**" (AlanWalk) &ndash; to auto-generate TOCs
