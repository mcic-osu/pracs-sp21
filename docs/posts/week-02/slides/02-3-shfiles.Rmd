## Create a dummy project &ndash; following Buffalo

- Go to the dir for this week you created earlier:
  ```sh
  $ cd /fs/ess/PAS1855/users/$USER/week02
  ```
  
- Create a set of directories representing a dummy project:

  ```sh
  $ mkdir zmays-snps
  $ cd zmays-snps
  $ mkdir -p data/seqs scripts analysis
  ```

--

- Create some empty "sequence files":
  ```sh
  $ cd data/seqs
  $ touch sample1_F.fastq.gz sample1_R.fastq.gz \
        sample2_F.fastq.gz sample2_R.fastq.gz \
        sample3_F.fastq.gz sample3_R.fastq.gz
  ```

--

- For a nice overview of your directory structure:

  ```sh
  $ tree ../../..
  ```
---

## VS Code prep

.content-box-diy[
**Add a keyboard shortcut to run shell commands from the editor:**

- Gear icon `r icon::fa("cog")` in bottom-left > `Keyboard Shortcuts`.

- Find `Terminal: Run Selected Text in Active Terminal`,
  then add a shortcut, e.g. <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>.
]

.content-box-info[
In *VS Code*, there are default existing keybindings for the
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> (*cut to end of line*) and 
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd> (*go to end of line*) combinations,  
so they won't be properly interpreted by the shell.

If you have an <kbd>end</kbd> key, that will also work to move to the end of
the line.

Alternatively, you can reconfigure keyboard shortcuts &ndash;  
see [this slide](#vscode-kbd).

## Shell expansion I: Wildcard expansion

|Wildcard | Matches |
|-|-|
| * | Any number of any character, including nothing |
| ? | Any single character 
| [] and [^] | One or none (`^`) of the "character set" within the brackets   

--

- With the following files in a directory:
  ```sh
  # sample1_F.fastq.gz sample1_R.fastq.gz
  # sample2_F.fastq.gz sample2_R.fastq.gz
  # sample3_F.fastq.gz sample3_R.fastq.gz
  ```

- **To match both "*sample1*" files:**
  ```sh
  $ ls sample1_?.fastq.gz
  $ ls sample1*
  $ ls sample1*fastq.gz
  ```

  # sample2_F.fastq.gz sample2_R.fastq.gz
  # sample3_F.fastq.gz sample3_R.fastq.gz
  ```

- **To match files for sample1 and sample2 using only a character class:**
  ```sh
  $ ls sample[12]*   # Use the character class notation
  $ ls sample[1-2]*  # Can use ranges like [0-9], [A-Z], [a-z].
  $ ls sample[^3]*   # Other way around: exclude sample3
  ```

--

  .content-box-warning[
  `[]` works on character ranges only: 0-9 works but 10-13 does not.
  ]

---

## Shell expansion I: Wildcard expansion (cont.)

- Wildcards are only used to *match and expand to* existing file names:  
  this process is also referred to as "**_globbing_**".

.content-box-q[  
Why do we call globbing a type of ***shell* expansion**?
]

--

.content-box-answer[  
The expansion &ndash;to all matching file names&ndash; is done *by the shell*,   
not by `ls` or another command you might be using wildcards with.  
  
**Therefore, `ls` will see the list of files *after* the expansion.**
]

--

- You can make use of this when using shell expansion to *move* or *delete* files:
  first check what your command will "see", then execute:
  ```sh
  $ echo sample[12]*  # Or use `ls`
  # sample1_F.fastq.gz sample1_R.fastq.gz sample2_F.fastq.gz sample2_R.fastq.gz
  
  $ rm !$     # !$: recall last arg of last command
  ```

---

## Shell expansion I: Wildcard expansion (cont.)

<br>

- Examples so far may seem trivial, but you can use these techniques to easily
  operate on selections among 100s or 1000s of files.

<br>

--

- Don't confuse wildcards with regular expressions!

  - What do **`*`** and **`?`** mean in regular expressions?

  - Regular expressions are useful across the board in programming,  
    and we will have a Python module devoted to them (week 11).

## Shell expansion II: Brace expansion

```sh
cd ../..    # to: zmays-snps
```

<br>

*Wildcard expansion* looks for corresponding files and expands to whichever
files are present: can't be used to create files or dirs.

**_Brace expansion_**, on the other hand, expands to whatever you tell it to:

--

- Use `..` to indicate ranges:
  ```sh
  $ mkdir -p data/obs/2021-01-{01..31} # Numeric range works!
  
  $ mkdir figs
  $ touch figs/fig-1{A..F}             # Character range works
  ```

- Use a comma-separated list:
  ```sh
  $ mkdir data/obs/treatment-{Kr,Df,Tr}_temp-{lo,med,hi}
  ```

---

## Shell expansion II: Brace expansion

*Wildcard expansion* looks for corresponding files and expands to whichever
files are present: can't be used to create files or dirs.

**_Brace expansion_**, on the other hand, expands to whatever you tell it to.  

.content-box-q[
What will happen in these two cases?
  
  ```sh
  $ cd figs
  $ ls
  # fig-1A fig-1B fig-1C fig-1D fig-1E fig-1F
  ```
  
  ```sh
  $ ls fig-1[A-G]
  ```
  
  ```sh
  $ ls fig-1{A..G}
  ```
]

---

## Shell expansion II: Brace expansion

*Wildcard expansion* looks for corresponding files and expands to whichever
files are present: can't be used to create files or dirs.

**_Brace expansion_**, on the other hand, expands to whatever you tell it to.  
  
.content-box-answer[
- Wildcard expansion will ignore the missing "*plot-G*":
```sh
$ ls fig-1[A-G]
# fig-1A fig-1B fig-1C fig-1D fig-1E fig-1F
```

- Brace expansion will complain about the missing "*plot-G*":
```sh
$ ls fig-1{A..G}
# ls: cannot access 'plot-G': No such file or directory
# fig-1A fig-1B fig-1C fig-1D fig-1E fig-1F
```
]

---

## `r icon::fa("user-edit")` Your turn: File matching

1. Go into `zmays-snps/data/seqs/` and remove the files in there.

2. Using *brace expansion* and the **`touch`** command,
  create empty `R1` and `R2` fastq files for 100 samples with IDs from `001`
  to `100`: `sample<ID>_R1_001.fastq` and `sample<ID>_R2_001.fastq`.

3. Using *wildcard matching* and by piping **`ls`** output into **`wc -l`**,  
  count the number of "`R1`" files (forward reads).

4. **_Bonus:_** Copy all files *except the two for "`sample100`"* into a new
  directory called `selection` &mdash;
  use a wildcard to do the move with a single command.
  (You will first need to create the new dir separately.)

---

## `r icon::fa("user-edit")` Solutions: File matching

1. Go into `zmays-snps/data/seqs/` and remove the files in there.
```sh
$ cd ../data/seqs/   # Assuming you were still in figs
$ rm *fastq.gz
```

2. Create empty `R1` and `R2` fastq files for 100 samples:
```sh
$ touch sample{001..100}_R{1,2}_001.fastq
```

3. Count the number of `R1` files:
```sh
$ ls sample*R1*fastq | wc -l
$ ls *R1* | wc -l # This works too but restrictive is often better
```

4. **_Bonus:_** Copy all files except "`sample100`" into a new dir called
   `selection`:
```sh
$ mkdir selection
$ cp sample[^1]* selection/
```

class: inverse middle center
name: command-sub

# Shell expansion III: Command substitution
----
<br><br><br>

---

## Shell expansion III: Command substitution

- **Command substitution** allows you to store and pass the output of a command
  (or pipeline of commands) to another command.
  
  These two examples show how that can be useful, and that a pipe wouldn't work:
  ```sh
  $ echo "I have $(ls *fastq | wc -l) fastq files."
  # I have 200 fastq files.
    
  $ mkdir results_$(date +%F)
  # results_2021-01-05
  ```

--

<br>

- It's often convenient to save the result in a *variable*:
  ```sh
  $ n_files=$(ls *fastq | wc -l)
  $ echo "$n_files"
  ```

---

## Side note: Special characters and escaping them

We've seen that the wildcards **`*`** and **`?`** have a special meaning.  

What if we had unwieldy file names,
and needed to match a *literal* **`*`** or **`?`**

--

- A **backslash** ("**`\`**") can be used to "escape" the special meaning
  of the character that follows it:
  ```sh
  $ ls
  # 'my bad*file'
  $ rm my\ bad\*file  # Tab autocomplete will work and insert \'s
  ```

--

- **Quoting** a string of characters will also escape special meaning
  of characters within them, with single quotes (**`'...'`**) being more severe
  than double quotes (**`"..."`**) &mdash; more on this later. 

  ```sh
  $ rm 'my bad*file'
  ```

--

.content-box-info[
Backslashes can also *assign* special meaning
&ndash; e.g. **`\t`** (tab) and **`\n`** (newline).
We'll talk more about these *regular expressions* later.

class: inverse middle center
name: renaming

# Programmatically renaming files
----
<br><br><br>

---

## Programmatically renaming files

- There are many different ways to do this in the shell &ndash;  
  admittedly none as easy as one might have hoped.
  
- Here, we'll use the `basename` command and a `for` loop.

- `basename` strips any dir name that may be present from a file name (path),
  and optionally, removes a suffix:
  ```sh
  $ basename selection/sample001_R1_001.fastq
  # sample001_R1_001.fastq
  
  # Specify a suffix:
  $ basename selection/sample001_R1_001.fastq "_001.fastq"
  # sample001_R1
  ```

---

## Programmatically renaming files (cont.)
  
`for` loops are a verbose method for tasks like renaming,  
but are intuitive and good practice.
  
- The following shows the basic syntax of a for loop,
  and how the variable that is looped over is *assigned* to `oldname`,
  but *recalled* as `${oldname}`:

  ```sh
  $ for oldname in *.fastq
  > do
  >   echo "Old name: $oldname"
  > done
  ```

--

.content-box-info[
Note how we are using *globbing* (wildcard file name matching)
to define what will be looped over.
]

---

## Programmatically renaming files (cont.) 

`for` loops are a verbose way for tasks like renaming,  
but are intuitive and good practice.
  
- Next, we assign a new name for each file, and `echo` the names as  
  a sanity check:
  
  ```sh
  $ for oldname in *.fastq
  > do
  >   newname=$(basename "$oldname" _001.fastq).fq
  >   echo "Old/new name: $oldname $newname"
  > done
  ```

---

## Programmatically renaming files (cont.) 
  
`for` loops are a verbose way for tasks like renaming,  
but are intuitive and good practice.
  
- Finally, we add the actual `mv` command:  

  ```sh
  $ for oldname in *.fastq
  > do
  >   newname=$(basename "$oldname" _001.fastq).fq
  >   echo "Old/new name: $oldname $newname"
  >   mv "$oldname" "$newname"
  > done
  ```

# Treating data as read-only:
# Viewing and modifying file permissions
----
<br><br><br>

---

## Showing file permissions

- To show file permissions, use **`ls`**  with the **`-l`** (*long* format)
  option.shows file permissions.
  
  (The command below also uses the **`-a`** option to show all files,
  including hidden ones, and **`-h`** shows file sizes in "human-readable"
  format.)

<p align="center">
<img src=img/long-ls.png width="700">
</p>

---

## File permission notation in `ls -l`

<br>

<p align="center">
<img src=img/permissions.png width="400">
</p>

<br>

--

.content-box-info[
Generally, it is prudent to not give "others" write permissions.
]

---

## Changing file permissions

This can be done in several ways with the `chmod` command:

```sh
# chmod <who>=<permission-to-set>`:
$ chmod a=rwx
  
# chmod <who>+<permission-to-add>:
$ chmod a+r  
# chmod <who>-<permission-to-remove>:
$ chmod o-w
```

--

- Using numbers:
  
.pull-left[
| Nr | Permission     |
|----|----------------|
| 1  | e**x**ecute    |
| 2  | **w**rite      |
| 4  | **r**ead       |
| 5  | r + x          |
| 6  | r + w          |
| 7  | r + w + x      |
]

.pull-right[
Three numbers are needed to specify permissions for user, group, and others:
```sh
# rwx permissions for all:
$ chmod 777 file.txt
# rwx for me, r for others:
$ chmod 744 file.txt
```
]

---

## File permissions &ndash; Making your data read-only

**To make your raw data read-only:**
  ```sh
  $ chmod a=r data/raw/*       # all=read
  
  $ chmod u-w data/raw/*       # Remove write permission
  
  $ chmod 400 data/raw/*       # User: read, group & others: none
  ```

--
<br>

.content-box-info[
**Dir permissions.**  
One tricky aspects of file permissions is that to list a directory's content,
you need *execute* permissions for the dir!

This is something to take into account when you want to grant others
access to your project e.g. at OSC.

To set execute permissions *only for dirs* throughout a dir hierarchy:
```sh
chmod -R a+X my-project-dir  # Note the *uppercase* X
```
]

---

## Changing file permissions: In practice

- First, let's look at the original permissions of the files:
  ```sh
  # Assuming you are still in week02/zmays-snps/data/seqs
  $ ls -l selection/
  ```

- Then, limit permissions for **a**ll to **r**ead, and check what we did:
  ```sh
  $ chmod a=r selection/*
  $ ls -l selection/
  ```
--

- What happens when we try to remove write-protected files?
  ```sh
  $ rm selection/*
  
  $ rm -f selection/*
  ```

  .content-box-info[
  While *you* (the file owner) can still remove write-protected files,
  others really can't read/write/execute files without appropriate permissions.
  ]

---

## Sidenote: "The Unix Chainsaw"

- What will these two commands do?
  (Recall: **`-f`** for *force*, **`-r`** for *recursive*.)
  ```sh
  $ rm -rf tmp-data/aligned-reads*
  
  $ rm -rf tmp-data/aligned-reads *
  ```

--

- What are we removing with the last command?
  ```sh
  $ mkdir "raw sequences"
  $ mkdir sequences
  
  $ rm -rf raw sequences
  ```

--

.content-box-warning[
Be careful with `rm`, especially `-r` / `-f` / `-rf`.

- Using **`-i`** (*interactive*) can be helpful in some cases.

- You can avoid `-r` by first removing files and *then* the empty dir
  using the `rmdir` command (only works when a dir is empty).
]

---
class: inverse middle center
name: symlinks

# Using files across projects:
# Using symbolic links
----
<br><br><br>

---

## Creating symbolic links: single files

- A symbolic (or soft) links only links to the *path* of the original file,
  whereas a hard link directly links to the *contents* of the original file.
  
  Modifying a file via either a hard or soft link *will* modify
  the original file.

--

- Create a *symlink* to a file using `ln -s <source-file> [<link-name>]`:
  ```sh
  # Only provide source: create link of the same name in the wd:
  $ ln -s ~/share/scripts/align.sh
  
  # The link can also be given an arbitrary name/path:
  $ ln -s ~/share/scripts/align.sh align_from-shared.sh
  ```

--

.content-box-info[
It's best to always **use an absolute path for the source file(s)**.  

The `$PWD` environment variable can come in handy to do so:
```sh
$ ln -s $PWD/shared-scripts/align.sh project1/scripts/
```
]

---

## Creating symbolic links: multiple files

- Link to multiple files in a directory at once:
  ```sh
  $ ln -s $PWD/shared_scripts/* project1/scripts/ 
  ```

- Link to a directory:
  ```sh
  $ ln -s $PWD/shared_scripts/ project1/scripts/
  $ ln -s $PWD/shared_scripts/ project1/scripts/ln-shared-scripts
  ```

--

.content-box-warning[
Be careful when linking to *directories*: you are creating  
a **point of entry to the original dir**.  
  
Therefore, even if you enter via the symlink, you are interacting
with the original files: 
    
**Do not use `rm -rf symlink-to-dir`!**
  
Instead, `rm symlink-to-dir` or `unlink symlink-to-dir` will only
remove the link.
]

---

## Creating symbolic links: practice

.content-box-diy[
Create a symbolic link in your `$HOME` dir that points to your personal dir in the project dir (`/fs/ess/PAS1855/users/$USER`).

If you don't provide a name for the link, it will be your username (why?),
which is not particularly informative about its destination.
Therefore, give it a name that makes sense to you,
like `PLNTPTH8300-SP21` or `pracs-sp21`. 
]

--

.content-box-answer[
```sh
$ ln -s /fs/ess/PAS1855/users/$USER $HOME/PLNTPTH8300-SP21
```
]

--

.content-box-q[
What will happen if you do `rm -rf $HOME/PLNTPTH8300-SP21`?
]

--

.content-box-answer[
The content of the original dir will be removed.

## Bonus: More conditional file processing

**To remove all empty files in a directory:**

```sh
$ for file in *
> do
>   if [ ! -s "$file" ]
>   then
>      echo rm "$file"
>   fi
> done
```

An overview of *file test operators* that can be used in this way:

| operator | returns true if:
|----------|----------------
| -s       | file is not zero size
| -e       | file exists
| -f       | file is a regular file (e.g. not a directory)
| -d       | file is a directory 
| -h       | file is a symbolic link
| -r/w/x   | file has read/write/execute permissions
