## Getting set up at OSC

- **Launch VS Code**:  
  Go to <https://ondemand.osc.edu> => `Interactive Apps` =>
  `Code Server` => 1 or 2 hours => `Launch` ... => `Connect to VS Code`.
  
- **Open your workspace**:  
  On the *Welcome* page, under the heading `Recent`,
  your workspace should be listed ("`<workspace-name> (Workspace)`").
  
- **Open a terminal in VS Code:**  
  (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>backtick</kbd>
  or `r icon::fa("bars")` => `Terminal` => `New Terminal`),
  and issue the command `bash` to break out of the Singularity shell.

----

- **Load the Git module:**
  ```sh
  $ module load git
  ```

- **Move to the following dir:**
  ```sh
  $ cd week03/originspecies # From /fs/ess/PAS1855/users/$USER/
  ```

# Remote repositories on GitHub

----

<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

---

## Remote repositories

We have been locally version-controlling our `originspecies` repo,  
but now we also want to **put this repo online**, to:

- Share our work and/or

- Have an online backup and/or

- Collaborate with others.

<br>

We will use the **GitHub website** as the place to host our online repositories.

<br>

.content-box-info[
Online counterparts of repositories that we also have locally are usually
referred to as "remote repositories" or "remotes".

To add and manage remotes, we use the `git remote` command.
]

---

## Creating remote repositories

While we can *interact* with online repos using Git commands,  
we **can't _create_ a new online repo with the Git CLI**.

So, we need to go to the GitHub website to create a new online repo.

--

<br> <br> <br> <br>

.content-box-info[
VS Code does provide functionality to create GitHub repos directly.
We may look at this later in the course, but if you're interested,
look for the `GitLens` extension by Eric Amodio.

## Link up the local and remote repositories

<p align="center">
<img src=img/github-newrepo2.png width=63%>
</p>

.content-box-info[
You can click on the `HTTPS`/`SSH` button to change the URL type.
]

---

## Link up the local and remote repositories (cont.)

We go back to the shell, where we'll enter the commands that GitHub provided
to us under "*...or push an existing repository from the command line*".

- First, we tell Git to add a "remote" connection with `git remote`.  
  We provide three arguments to this command:
  
  - `add` &ndash; because we're adding a remote.
  
  - `origin` &ndash; the nickname we're giving the connection.  
    This is an arbitrary name but is usually *origin* by convention.   
  
  - The SSH URL to the GitHub repo.

  ```sh
  # git remote add <remote-nickname> <URL>
  $ git remote add origin git@github.com:<user>/originspecies.git
  ```

---

## Link up the local and remote repositories (cont.)

- Second, we rename the default branch, from `master` to `main`
  (GitHub since recently uses `main` as the default branch):
  ```sh
  $ git branch -M main
  ```

- Third, we push our local repo to remote using `git push`.  
  Whenever we push a branch for the first time,  
  we need to use the `-u` option to set up an "**u**pstream" counterpart:
  ```sh
  $ git push -u origin main
  ```

--

.content-box-info[
When not given any arguments, `git push` pushes:
 - To & from the **currently active *branch*** (default: `master`/`main`)
 - To the **default remote connection**.

Therefore, from now on, we can mostly just use:

```sh
$ git push
```
]

---

## Explore the repository on GitHub

- Back at GitHub, click on `Code` in the lower of the top bars.  
  Now, we can see the files that we just uploaded from our local repo.

<p align="center">
<img src="img/github-code-button.png" width="50%">
</p>

- Next, click where it says `x commits` (should be 4) with a clock icon,  
  and you'll get an overview of commits somewhat like with `git log`.

<p align="center">
<img src="img/github-x-commits.png" width="40%">
</p>

--

- On the right hand side, there are three buttons for each commit:

  - Click the hash (hexadecimal ID) to see changes made by that commit.
  
  - Click the <kbd>< ></kbd> to see the state of the repo at the time
    of that commit.
  
<p align="center">
<img src="img/github-commits.png" width="35%">
</p>

---

## Remote repos &ndash; Single-user workflow

In a single-user workflow, all changes are made in the *local repo*,  
and the remote repo is simply periodically updated (*pushed to*).

So, the interaction between local and remote is unidirectional:

<figure>
<p align="center">
<img src="img/buffalo-remote-uni.png" width="35%">
<figcaption>Figure from Buffalo (2015)</figcaption>
</p>
</figure>

---

## Remote repos &ndash; Single-user workflow (cont.)

In our day-to-day work, we now commit as usual, and in addition,  
*push* to remote occasionally:

- Let's add a README.md file, and commit:
  ```sh
  $ echo "# Origin" > README.md
  $ echo "Repo for book draft on my new **theory**" >> README.md
  $ git add README.md
  $ git commit -m "Added a README"
  ```

- Now, we push to the remote repository:
  ```sh
  $ git push
  ```

--

.content-box-info[
If we go back to GitHub, we see that the contents of the README.md
automatically shows up as a rendered Markdown file!
]

---

## Remote repos &ndash; Multi-user workflow

A multi-user workflow starts when a second user downloads (*clones*)  
the online repo, as in **(b)** below:

<figure>
<p align="center">
<img src="img/buffalo-remote-1.png" width="70%">
<figcaption>Figure from Buffalo (2015)</figcaption>
</p>
</figure>

---

## Remote repos &ndash; Multi-user workflow

- Then, the second user can push their changes to the shared remote **(a)**:

<figure>
<p align="center">
<img src="img/buffalo-remote-2a.png" width="70%">
<figcaption>Figure from Buffalo (2015)</figcaption>
</p>
</figure>

---

## Remote repos &ndash; Multi-user workflow

- Then, the second user can push their changes to the shared remote **(a)**:

<figure>
<p align="center">
<img src="img/buffalo-remote-2.png" width="70%">
<figcaption>Figure from Buffalo (2015)</figcaption>
</p>
</figure>

- To go full circle, you *pull* in
  the changes made by the second user **(b)**. 

.content-box-info[
`git pull` is two commands in one: `git fetch` to download the updates
from remote and store them in a branch,
and `git merge` to merge the newly fetched branch into you current branch.
]

---

## Remote repos &ndash; Multi-user workflow

.content-box-info[
**Recap:**  

With a multi-user workflow, changes made by different users are *shared via
the online copy of the repo.*

*Syncing is not automatic*:

- Changes to your local repo remain local-only until you **push** to remote.

- Someone else's changes to the remote repo do not make it into your
  local repo until you **pull** from remote.

But Git will tell you about "divergence" between local remote,
when you check `git status`:
<figure>
<p align="center">
<img src="img/git-sync.png" width="90%">
</p>
</figure>
]

---

## What can you do with <br> someone else's GitHub repository?

If you do not have rights to *push*, you can:
  
  - **Clone** the repo and make changes locally (as we do with `CSB`).  
    You can also *pull* to remain up-to-date with changes in the original repo. 
  
  - **Fork** the repository on GitHub and develop it independently.  
    Forking creates *a new personal GitHub repo*, to which you can push.
  
  - Using a forked repo, you can also submit a **Pull Request** with proposed
    changes to the *original repo*.

.content-box-info[
See [these bonus slides]((#pr) for more info on a fork => Pull Request workflow.
]

--

.content-box-info[
If you're collaborating on a project,
you should ask your collaborator to give you admin rights for the repo.
]

---

## GitHub Issues

- Each GitHub repository has "Issues" tab &ndash; issues are mainly used to
  track bugs and other (potential) problems with a repository.

- In an issue, you can reference specific commits and people,
  and use Markdown formatting.
  
- In your Graded Assignment for this week, you will create an issue simply
  to notify me about your repository.

.content-box-info[
**Forking**, **Pull Requests**, and **Issues** are Git*Hub* functionality,  
and not part of Git.

# Branching & merging

----

<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

---

## A repo with a couple of commits

- First, we create a dummy repo with a few commits by running a script:
  ```sh
  $ cd /fs/ess/PAS1855/users/$USER/CSB/git/sandbox
  
  # Have a look at the script:
  $ less ../data/create_repository.sh  # press `q` to exit less
  
  # Run the script, which will create our repo:
  $ ../data/create_repository.sh
  
  # Move to the repo dir:
  $ cd branching_example
  ```

--

- Let's see what has been done in this repo:
  ```sh
  $ git log --oneline # --oneline: 1-line summary per commit
  ```

- We will later modify the file `code.txt` &ndash;
  let's see what it contains now:  
  ```sh
  $ cat code.txt
  ```

---

## *Branches* in Git

- *We now want to improve the code, but these changes are experimental,*  
  and we want to retain our previous version that we know works.
  
- This is where ***branching*** comes in.

  With a new branch, we can make changes that don't affect the `master` branch,
  and we can also keep working on the `master` branch:
  
<figure>
<p align="center">
<img src="img/csb-branch-intro.png" width="75%">
<figcaption>Figure modified after Allesino & Wilmes (2019)</figcaption>
</p>
</figure>

---

## Creating a new branch

- First, we create a new branch as follows:
  ```sh
  $ git branch fastercode   # We name the branch "fastercode"
  ```

- Let's see what our log looks like now, and list the branches:
  ```sh
  $ git log --oneline
  ```
  
  ```sh
  $ git branch  # Without args, git branch will list the branches
  ```

--

- It turns out we created a new branch *but we are still on the master branch*.
  We can **switch branches with `git checkout`**:
  ```sh
  $ git checkout fastercode
  
  $ git branch   # Should now show we are on `fastercode`
  $ git status   # Should also tell us we are on `fastercode`
  ```

---

## Making experimental changes on the new branch

- We edit the code, stage and commit the changes:
  ```sh
  $ echo "Yeah, faster code" >> code.txt
  $ cat code.txt
  $ git add code.txt
  $ git commit -m "Managed to make code faster"
  ```

- Let's check the log again:
  ```sh
  $ git log --oneline # Last commit: on branch "fastercode"
  ```

---

## Moving back to the `master` branch

- We need to switch gears and add references to the paper draft.  
  Since this has nothing to do with our attempt at faster code,  
  we should make these changes **back on the `master` branch**:
  
  ```sh
  $ git checkout master # move back to master
  ```

- What does `code.txt`, which we edited on `fastercode`, now look like?

  ```sh
  $ cat code.txt  # Our working dir contents has changed!!
  ```

- Now, let's add the reference, stage and commit:  
  ```sh
  $ echo "Marra et al. 2014" > references.txt
  $ git add references.txt
  $ git commit -m "Fixed the references"
  ```

--

- Now we've made changes to each of the two branches,
  let's see the log in "graph" format with `--graph`,
  also listing all branches with `--all`:
  ```sh
  $ git log --oneline --graph --all
  ```

---

## Finishing up on the experimental branch

- Earlier, we finished speeding up the code at the `fastercode` branch,
  but we still need to document our changes.
  So, we go back:
  ```sh
  $ git checkout fastercode
  ```

- Do we still have the `references.txt` file from the `master` branch?
  ```sh
  $ ls
  ```
 
- Then, we add the "documentation" to the code, stage and commit:
  ```sh
  $ echo "# My documentation" >> code.txt
  $ git add code.txt
  $ git commit -m "Added comments to the code"
  ```

- Again we check the log graph:  
  ```sh
  $ git log --oneline --all --graph
  ```

---

## Merging the branches

- We are happy with the changes to the code, and want to make the `fastercode`
  version *the default version of the code*.
  
  This means we should merge the `fastercode` branch back into `master`.
  To do so, we first have to move back to `master`:
  ```sh
  $ git checkout master
  ```

- Now we are ready to merge, and we use the `git merge` command.  
  We also provide a commit message, *because a merge is always accompanied
  by a commit*:
  ```sh
  $ git merge fastercode -m "Much faster version of code"
  ```

- Once again, we check the log graph:  
  ```sh
  $ git log --oneline --all --graph
  ```

---

## Cleaning up

- We no longer need the `fastercode` branch, so we can delete it:
  ```sh
  $ git branch -d fastercode
  ```

- And again we check the log graph:
  ```sh
  $ git log --oneline --all --graph
  ```

---

# Some Git best practices

----

<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

---

## Some Git best practices

- **Write informative commit messages.**  
  Imagine looking back at your project
  in a few months, after finding an error that you introduced a while ago.

  - **Bad:** "Updated file"
  - **Good:** "Updated x function to include y"

<figure>
<p align="center">
<img src="img/xkcd-git-commit-msg.png" width="70%">

---

## Some Git best practices

- **Write informative commit messages.**  
  Imagine looking back at your project
  in a few months, after finding an error that you introduced a while ago.

  - **Bad:** "*Updated file*"
  - **Good:** "*Updated x function to include y*"

<br>

.content-box-info[
It is often argued that commit messages should preferably be in the form of
completing the sentence "*This commit will...*":

When adhering to this, the above commit message would instead say
"*Update x function to include y*".
]

---

## Some Git best practices (cont.)

- **Commit often, using small commits.**  
  This will also help to keep commit messages informative!

- **Before committing, check what you've changed.**  
  Use `git diff [--staged]` or VS Code functionality.

.content-box-info[
**Avoid including unrelated changes in commits**  
Separate commits if your working dir contains work from disparate edits:
use `git add` + `git commit` separately for two sets of files.
]

--

- **When collaborating: pull often.**  
  This will reduce the chances of *[merge conflicts](#merge-conflict)*.

- **Don't commit unnecessary files.**  
  These can also lead to conflicts &ndash; especially automatically generated,
  temporary files.

---

## Some Git best practices (cont.)

- If you have a repo with general scripts,
  which you continue to develop and use in multiple projects,
  and you publish a paper in which you use these scripts:
  
  Add a "**_tag_**" to a commit to mark the version of the scripts
  used in your analysis.
 
  ```sh
  $ git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Clever release title"
  $ git push --follow-tags # To push all annotated tags to the remote
  ```

## Merge conflicts and resolving them

A **merge conflict** can occur when all three of the following conditions are met:

- You try to merge two branches
  (including when pulling from remote: recall that a pull includes a merge),
  and:
  
- One or more files have been changed (via commits) on **_both_** of these
  branches since their divergence.
  
- Some of these changes were made in the same part(s) of file(s).

--

<br>

When this occurs, Git has no way of knowing which changes to keep,  
and it will report a merge conflict as follows:

<p align="center">
<img src=img/merge-conflict-start.png width=90%>
</p>


---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## *Merge conflicts* and resolving them (cont.)

When you get a merge conflict, follow these steps:

1. Use `git status` to find the conflicting file(s).

## *Merge conflicts* and resolving them (cont.)

When you get a merge conflict, follow the following steps:

1. Use `git status` to find the conflicting file(s).

2. Open and edit those files manually to a version that fixes the conflict.

.content-box-info[
Git has changed this file to add the conflicting lines from both versions
of the file, and to add marks indicating these conflicting lines:

```sh
On the Origin of Species # Line preceding conflicting line
<<<<<<< HEAD # GIT MARK 1: Next line = current branch
Second line of the book - from main # Conflict line: current branch
======= # GIT MARK 2: Dividing line
Second line of the book - from conflict-branch # Conflict line: incoming branch
>>>>>>> conflict-branch # GIT MARK 3: Prev line = incoming branch
```

You have to manually change the contents in your text editor to keep the
conflicting content that you want, and to remove the indicator marks that
Git made.

## Forking a GitHub repository

- Go to a GitHub repository, and click the "**_Fork_**" button in the top-right:
  
  <p align="center">
  <img src=img/github-fork.png width=50%>
  </p>
  
  You'll be asked which account or organization to fork to
  (you should pick your personal account, which is likely the only one you have).

<br>

- Now, you have your own version of the repository,  
  and it is labeled explicitly as a fork:

<p align="center">
<img src=img/github-forked.png width=55%>
</p>

## Forking workflow

You can't directly modify the *original repository*, but you can:

- First, **modify your fork** (with local edits and pushing).

- Then, **submit a so-called Pull Request** to the owner of the original repo
  to pull in your changes.
  
- Also, you can also easily **keep your fork up-to-date** with changes to the
  original repository.

## Editing the forked repository

- Clone your forked GitHub repository to your computer.

  Find the URL for the GitHub repository by clicking the green `Code` button.
  
  Make sure you get the SSH URL, and then click the clipboard button
  next to the URL to copy it.
  
  <p align="center">
  <img src=img/github-clone.png width=50%>
  </p>
  
  
  ```sh
  $ git clone git@github.com:jelmerp/originspecies.git
  ```

## Editing the forked repository (cont.)

Now, we can make changes to the repository in the familiar way:

  ```sh
  $ echo "# Chapter 1. Variation under domestication" > origin.txt
  
  $ git add origin.txt
  $ git commit -m "Suggested title for first chapter."
  
  $ git push origin
  ```

## Creating a Pull Request

- If we then go back to GitHub,
  we see that our forked repo is "*x commit(s) ahead*" of the original repo:
  
  <p align="center">
  <img src=img/github-fork-ahead.png width=100%>
  </p>
  
- Click `Pull Request`, and check whether the right repositories and branches
  are being compared:

  <p align="center">
  <img src=img/github-pr-compare.png width=100%>
  </p>

  You can also see the changes that were made in this window.

- If it looks good, click the green `Create Pull Request` button:
  <p align="center">
  <img src=img/github-pr.png width=100%>
  </p>

## Creating a Pull Request (cont.)

- Give your pull request a title,
  and write a brief description of your changes:

  <p align="center">
  <img src=img/github-pr-confirm.png width=100%>
  </p>

## Keeping your fork up-to-date

- As we saw, you can't directly *push* to original repo but instead have to submit
  a Pull Request (yes, this terminology is confusing!).
  
  But, you *can* create an ongoing connection to the original repo,
  which you can use to periodically *pull* to keep your fork up-to-date.
  
  This works similarly to connecting your own GitHub repo:
  
```sh
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:jelmerp/originspecies.git

# List the remotes:
$ git remote -v
origin   git@github.com:pallass-boszanger/originspecies.git  (fetch)
origin   git@github.com:pallass-boszanger/originspecies.git  (push)
upstream   git@github.com:jelmerp/originspecies.git  (fetch)
upstream   git@github.com:jelmerp/originspecies.git  (push)

# Pull from the upstream repository:
$ git pull upstream main
```
  
.content-box-info[
"*upstream*" is an arbitrary name often used by convention,  
as opposed to "origin" for your *own* version of the online repo.

name: stash

## `git stash`

Git stash can be useful when you need to pull from remote,
but have changes in your working dir that:
  
  - Are not appropriate for a separate commit
  
  - Are not worth starting a new branch for,
    because you want to get these
    changes back on the current branch immediately.

```sh
# Stash changes to tracked files:
$ git stash    # Note: add option -u to include untracked files

# Pull from the remote repository:
$ git pull

# Apply stashed changes:
$ git stash apply
```

name: amend

## Amending commits

Let's say we forgot to add a file to a commit,
or we notice a silly typo in something we just committed.
  
Creating a separate commit for this seems "wasteful" or even confusing,  
and including these changes along with others in a next commit is also likely
to be inappropriate. **In such cases, we can _amend_ the commit**.

- First, we stage the forgotten or fixed file: 
  ```sh
  $ git add <file>
  ```

- Then, we amend the commit (also using the `--no-edit` flag
  because we do not want change the commit message):
  ```sh
  $ git commit --amend --no-edit
  ```

.content-box-warning[
Because amending commits "changes history", some recommend avoiding this
altogether.
For sure, do **not** amend commits that have been published in (*pushed to*)
the online counterpart of the repo.

## More Git tidbits

- Git will not pay attention to *empty* directories.

- You can create a new branch and move to it in one go using:
  ```sh
  $ git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
  ```

- To show commits in which a specific file was changed, you can simply use:
  ```sh
  $ git log <filename>
  ```

- "*Aliases*" (command shortcuts) can be useful with Git,
  and can be added to the `~/.gitconfig` file or set with `git config`:
  ```sh
  [alias]
    hist = log --graph --pretty=format:'%h %ad | %s%d [%an]' --date=short
    last = log -1 HEAD  # Just show the last commit
  ```
  
  ```sh
  $ git config --global alias.last "log -1 HEAD"
  ```

## Add a collaborator in GitHub

- You can add a collaborator to a repository by going to the repository's
  settings:
