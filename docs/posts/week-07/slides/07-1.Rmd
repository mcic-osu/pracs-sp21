## Downloading data with `wget`

```sh
# Getting set up
$ # cd /fs/ess/PAS1855/user/$USER/ # You're probably already there
$ cd bds-files/chapter-06-bioinformatics-data/
$ mkdir hg19
$ cd hg19
```

`wget` will download files from a specified address, by default saving it using
the file name from the source:

```sh
$ wget http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/chromosomes/chr22.fa.gz

name: download

## Downloading data with `wget` (cont.)

- `wget` can also download multiple files at once with `--recursive`:

  ```sh
  # Fictional example, don't run
  $ wget --recursive \
        --no-parent --accept "*.gtf" \
        --no-directories \
        http://genomics.someuniversity.edu/labsite/annotation.html
  ```

- With `--recursive` set, downloads can get out of hand, so above,
  we used the following additional options:
  
  - `--no-parent` &mdash; Don't follow links to parent directories,
  - `--accept "*.gtf"` &mdash; Only download matching (here: GTF) files.

- Finally, we used `--no-directories` so downloaded files are all placed in a
  single dir and not in the same dir structure as the source.

--

.content-box-info[
Other useful options include `--level` to specify the number of directory levels
that should be recursively downloaded,  
and `--reject`, which does the opposite of `--accept`.   
]

---

## Downloading data with `curl`

`curl` is similar to `wget`, but can also download data using some additional
protocols such as SFTP (secure FTP).

If you use it, you should also be aware that it prints downloads to standard
out by default, so you should redirect (or use the `-O` option) to save
downloads to file:

```sh
$ curl http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/chromosomes/chr21.fa.gz \
      > chr21.fa.gz
```

## Ensuring data integrity with checksums

Remember the hexadecimal IDs we saw for Git commits?
These are *checksums*:

> *Checksums are very compressed summaries of data,
> computed in a way that even if just one bit of the data is changed,
> the checksum will be different.* &mdash; Buffalo Chapter 6

---

## Ensuring data integrity with checksums (cont.)

Several algorithms (& associated Unix commands) can compute checksums.

`SHA-1` checksums are the ones we've seen with Git and are preferred nowadays.
We use the `shasum` command to compute them, typically for a file or set of files
(as we did for commits), but we can even do it for a string:

```sh
$ echo "bioinformatics is fun" | shasum
#> f9b70d0d1b0a55263f1b012adab6abf572e3030b    -

$ echo "bioinformatic is fun" | shasum
#> e7f33eedcfdc9aef8a9b4fec07e58f0cf292aa67    -
```

Even though the string differed only very slightly,
the checksum is entirely different!

---

## Ensuring data integrity with checksums

- We can compute a checksum for one of the FASTA files we downloaded earlier:

  ```sh
  $ shasum chr22.fa.gz 
  #> d012edd46f50d674380460d3b4e91f450688e756  chr22.fa.gz
  ```

--

- Let's compute the checksums for both FASTA files, and save them in a file:

  ```sh
  $ shasum chr*.fa.gz > shasums.txt
  
  $ cat shasums.txt
  #> 4f418c07dc24d2bf23744df6c3394447707df97d  chr21.fa.gz
  #> d012edd46f50d674380460d3b4e91f450688e756  chr22.fa.gz
  ```

- Now, if we transfer these files elsewhere, we can use the checksums in the file
  to check if the files were transferred completely and correctly,
  using the `-c` option:

  ```sh
  $ shasum -c shasums.txt
  #> chr21.fa.gz: OK
  #> chr22.fa.gz: OK
  ```

---

## Side note: Differences between files with `diff`

We have also seen the `diff` utility at work via `git diff`,
but it's important to realize you can also use it outside of the context
of Git repositories.

If you find that checksums differ for files that should be the same,
or just want to get an overview of differences between two similar text files,
use `diff`, optionally with the `-u` option:

```sh
$ diff -u ../gene-1.bed ../gene-2.bed
#> --- gene-1.bed  2020-11-28 16:54:27.098085903 -0500

# Compressed data

----

<br> <br> <br> <br>

---

## Compressed data: `gzip`

When we download data, it is often compressed with `gzip`
("gzipped", `.gz` extension).

Many programs can work with gzipped files directly,
but sometimes you do need to unzip them, which can be done with `gunzip`:

```sh
# gunzip unzips in place - the original zipped file disappears:
$ gunzip chr21.fa.gz
$ ls chr21*
#> chr21.fa

# To keep the original, output to stdout with "-c" and redirect:
$ gunzip -c chr22.fa.gz > chr22.fa
$ ls chr22*
#> chr22.fa  chr22.fa.gz
```

---

## Compressed data: `gzip` (cont.)

- Conversely, to zip files, we use `gzip`:

  ```sh
  $ gzip chr21.fa
  $ ls chr21*
  #> chr21.fa.gz
  
  # As with unzipping, use -c and redirect to keep the original:
  $ gzip -c chr22.fa > chr22_copy.fa.gz
  $ ls chr22*
  #> chr22_copy.fa.gz  chr22.fa  chr22.fa.gz
  ```

--

- Often, a program will *output unzipped data to standard out*,
  which we can immediately pipe to `gzip` so we only need to write the compressed
  file to disk (beneficial because reading/writing to files is time-consuming):

  ```sh
  $ trimmer in.fastq.gz | gzip > out.fastq.gz # don't run
  ```
  
  *(Note that because the input to `gzip` comes from standard in, the output
  will by default be to standard out!)*

---

## Working with compressed data directly

Several of our familiar shell commands have `z` counterparts that can work with
gzipped files directly: `zgrep`, `zless`, and `zcat` (and also `zdiff`).

```sh
# "zgrep" is "grep" for gzipped files:
$ zgrep -i -n --color "AGATAGATATAT" chr22.fa.gz
#> 589810:TATTGCAGGTAAGATGGGGCCACTCAGTACTTTAAAAAGATAGATATATA
#> 596134:tctatctatatatagatagatatattgtagatatatctatctatatatat
#> 966248:tatagatagatatataaaggggagtttattaagtattaactcacatgatc

# "zless" is "less" for gzipped files:
$ zless chr22.fa.gz

# "zcat" is "cat" for gzipped files:
$ zcat chr22.fa.gz | head
#> >chr22
#> NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
#> NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
#> NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN

name: transfer
background-color: #f2f5eb

## Small file transfers (<1 GB) to/from OSC with scp

```sh
# Example setup - copy downloaded files to home dir for quick access
$ cd ..
$ cp hg19 ~
```

One option is **`scp`** (secure copy), which works much like regular `cp`,
but to refer to remote,
we prepend the SSH connection address followed by `:`:

- Remote to local, and local to remote:
  
  ```sh
  $ scp <user>@pitzer.osc.edu:<remote-path> <local-path>
  $ scp <local-path> <user>@pitzer.osc.edu:<remote-path>
  ```

--

- For instance:
  
  ```sh
  $ scp -r jelmer@pitzer.osc.edu:~/chr22 ~
  $ scp -r ~/chr22 jelmer@pitzer.osc.edu:~
  ```

--

.content-box-info[
- Do transfers in either direction from your *local* shell.
- If you created SSH shortcuts, these will work here too!
]

---

## Small file transfers (<1 GB) to/from OSC with rsync

Another option, which I recommend, is the **`rsync`** command, 
especially when you have directories that you repeatedly want to *sync*:
`rsync` won't copy any files that are identical in source and
destination.

--

- A useful combination of options is `-avz --progress`:
  - `-a` enables archival mode (also makes `-r` unnecessary).
  - `-v` increases verbosity &ndash; tells you what is being copied.
  - `-z` enables compressed file transfer (=> faster).
  - `--progress` to show transfer progress for individual files.

  ```bash
  $ rsync -avz --progress ~/bds-files jelmer@owens.osc.edu:~
  ```

--

.content-box-info[
- Buffalo also uses the `-e ssh` option, but this is not necessary.
- See the bonus slides to if you get tricked by the trailing slash.

background-color: #f2f5eb

## Beware of the trailing slash with `rsync`

Presence/absence of a trailing slash for source directories makes a
difference to `rsync`.

- The following commands will do what you want:

  ```sh
  # Copy *contents* of source "scripts" into target "scripts":
  $ rsync -avz scripts/ backup/scripts
  
  # Copy the source dir "scripts" into target dir "backup"
  $ rsync -avz scripts backup
  
  $ ls scripts
  #> fastq.sh
  $ ls backup/scripts
  #> fastq.sh
  ```

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## Beware of the trailing slash with `rsync` (cont.)

- But these commands don't:

  ```sh
  # Copy source dir scripts *into* target dir scripts:
  $ rsync -avz scripts backup/scripts
  
  $ ls scripts
  #> fastq.sh
  $ ls backup/scripts
  #> scripts
  
  # Copy contents of "scripts" straight into "backup":
  $ rsync -avz scripts/ backup
  
  $ ls scripts
  #> fastq.sh
  $ ls backup/scripts
  #> ls: cannot access 'backup/scripts': No such file or directory
  ```

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## Transferring files with SFTP

You can also use `sftp`, which doesn't run on a login node,
so large transfers are permitted.
(Though for *very* large transfers, Globus is preferred.)

  - To log in:
  ```bash
  $ sftp sftp.osc.edu
  ```

  Now, you have an `sftp` prompt instead of a regular bash prompt.

--

- To upload files to remote, use the `put` command &ndash; and note that you
  don't need to designate remote with `:` syntax like for `scp`/`rsync`:

  ```sh
  sftp> put scripts/fastqc.sh /fs/ess/PAS1855/users/$USER/
  
  # If you don't specify a remote location, it be put in $HOME:
  sftp> put file.txt
  ```

--

- To download files from remote, use the `get` command:

  ```sh
  sftp> get /fs/ess/PAS1855/users/$USER/ ~/PP8300/OSC/
  ```

---
background-color: #f2f5eb
name: concat

## Concatenating compressed data

When it is okay to concatenate files (losing information about the original
file origin of the data), 
this can be done very easily.

- To add a second FASTQ file to an existing gzipped file,  
  we can simply use `>>`:

  ```sh
  $ ls
  #> in.fastq.gz in2.fastq
  
  $ gzip -c in2.fastq >> in.fastq.gz
  ```

- Even more conveniently, if we have two gzipped FASTQ file for the same sample
  but from different Illumina lanes:
  
  ```sh
  $ cat sampleA_L001_R1.fastq.gz sampleA_L002_R1.fastq.gz \
        > sampleA_R1.fastq.gz
  ```

background-color: #f2f5eb

## Process management: background processes

- To run a process in the background, put an `&` after the command:

  ```sh
  # du -sh example?
  $ program1 input.txt > results.txt &
  ```

- To check which processes are running in the background:

  ```sh
  $ jobs
  #> [1]+ Running        program1 input.txt > results.txt
  ```

- You can bring processes back to the foreground with `fg` and optionally
  using the ID provided (`[1]` above).
  
  The default is to bring the most recent process back to the foreground,
  so in this case, the following two would be equivalent:
  
  ```sh
  $ fg
  
  $ fg %1
  ```

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## Process management: background processes (cont.)

- To bring a process that is *already running* to the background,
  we need to first suspend (i.e., pause) the process:
  
  ```sh
  $ program1 input.txt > results.txt # forgot to append ampersand
  $ # enter control-z
  #> [1]+ Stopped
  program1 input.txt > results.txt
  $ bg
  #> [1]+ program1 input.txt > results.txt
  ```

.content-box-info[
Recall that Ctrl+C is used to kill a foreground process.
]

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## Process management: background processes (cont.)

- Even when a process is running in the background (after using `&`),
  closing the terminal would kill the process.
  
  To avoid this, you can use `nohup`:
  
  ```sh
  $ nohup du -sh ... &
  #> [1] 10900
  ```

- We can't bring a processing running with `nohup` back to the foreground,
  but to kill it, we can use the process ID printed above and the `kill` command:
  
  ```sh
  $ kill 10900
  ```

.content-box-info[
Alternatively, you can use a so-called "terminal multiplier" like `tmux`,
see Buffalo Chapter 4 details.
]

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## Process management: background processes (cont.)

- Using background processes can be useful in `for` loops,
  so that we simultaneously start a process for every iteration of the loop:
  
  ```sh
  $ for filename in *.fastq; do
        program "$filename" &
    done
  ```

- However, this launches as many processes as there are FASTQ files,
  which could be a problem and is still not very efficient if you have many
  more files than cores.
  
  To control this better, you can submit a separate SLURM job for each iteration
  instead, or use `xargs` or `parallel` for a non-loop solution
  (last week's bonus slides, and Buffalo Chapter 12).

# Bash configuration files and $PATH

----

<br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

background-color: #f2f5eb

## Bash configuration files

Your bash shell is configured using simple (hidden) text files in your `$HOME`:

- `~/.bashrc` &ndash; for non-login shells

- `~/.bash_profile` &ndash; for non-login shells

These can be viewed and edited like normal text files:

```sh
$ cat ~/.bashrc

$ nano ~/.bashrc    # Or open in VS Code
```

--

.content-box-info[
**Some settings that are / can be stored in these config files:**

- The look of your prompt.

- `alias`es &ndash; personal, custom shortcuts for (complex) commands.

- The `$PATH`, a list of directories with binaries (next slide).

- Other custom settings like running setup scripts.
]

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## Bash configuration files

Your bash shell is configured using simple (hidden) text files in your `$HOME`:

- `~/.bashrc` &ndash; for non-login shells

- `~/.bash_profile` &ndash; for non-login shells

These can be viewed and edited like normal text files:

```sh
$ cat ~/.bashrc

$ nano ~/.bashrc    # Or open in VS Code
```

<br>

.content-box-info[
To not have to deal with the login/non-login shell distinction, it is common
to put all settings in one of these files (often `.bashrc`) and let the second
file (often `.bash_profile`) run the first file whenever it itself is being run.
]

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## `$PATH`: A list of directories with binaries

- `$PATH` is another environment variable like `$HOME` and `$USER`.

- It lists the directories that will be searched when you type a program’s name.
  This allows you to run programs without specifying the full path to the executable.
  For example:
  
  ```sh
  $ vcftools
  #> VCFtools (0.1.16)
  #> (c) Adam Auton and Anthony Marcketta 2009
  
  # To check where the program's binary is located:
  $ which vcftools
  #> /usr/bin/vcftools
  ```

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## `$PATH`: A list of directories with binaries (cont.)

- To check which directories are in your `$PATH`, you can simply `echo` it:

  ```sh
  $ echo $PATH
  #> /apps/xalt/xalt/bin:/opt/mvapich2/intel/19.0/2.3.3/bin:/apps/gnu/8.4.0/bin:/opt/intel/19.0.5/itac_latest/bin:/opt/intel/19.0.5/advisor/bin64:/opt/intel/19.0.5/vtune_amplifier/bin64:/opt/intel/19.0.5/inspector_2019/bin64:/opt/intel/19.0.5/compilers_and_libraries_2019/linux/bin/intel64:/apps/software_usage:/usr/lib64/qt-3.3/bin:/opt/osc/bin:/opt/moab/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/opt/ibutils/bin:/opt/ddn/ime/bin:/opt/puppetlabs/bin:/users/PAS0471/jelmer/software/bin
  ```

<br>

- The output looks strange and is hard to read because the different directories
  in your `$PATH` are separated by colons `:`.
  Let's make that a bit more readable:
  
  ```sh
  $ echo $PATH | tr ":" "\n" | nl
  #> 1  /apps/xalt/xalt/bin
  #> 2  /opt/mvapich2/intel/19.0/2.3.3/bin
  #> 3  /apps/gnu/8.4.0/bin
  #> 4  /opt/intel/19.0.5/itac_latest/bin
  #> 5  /opt/intel/19.0.5/advisor/bin64
  #> ...
  ```

---
background-color: #f2f5eb

## `$PATH`: A list of directories with binaries (cont.)

- You can easily modify your `$PATH`.
  To add a directory to your `$PATH` in the current session,
  you simply *append* a new dir after a colon:

  ```sh
  $ PATH=$PATH:~/new-dir-with-software/
  ```

<br>

--

- However, this change will not have any effects outside of your current bash sessions.
  
  **For lasting changes**,
  you should edit your bash configuration files (like `~/.bashrc`),
  from which `$PATH` is loaded whenever you open a terminal:
  
  ```sh
  $ echo "PATH=$PATH:~/new-dir-with-software/" >> ~/.bashrc
  ```
