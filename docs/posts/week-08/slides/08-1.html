## Overview of this week

Today, we will set up VS Code for Python and work our way through CSB chapter
3.1-3.4 to get started with Python.

Thursday will focus on section 3.4: Python data structures.

&lt;br&gt;

## What is Python?

- Python is an all-purpose programming language that was created by
  Guido van Rossem, first released in 1991, and named after Monty Python.

&lt;br&gt;

- It is an *interpreted* (or *scripting*) language,
  which means that its code does not need to be *compiled* prior to execution.
  
  Instead, we can run scripts as-is, like we did with Bash scripts.
  
  Moreover, we can open up an interactive prompt and run commands one-by-one,
  like we also did in the shell.

---

## What is Python?

- ["The Zen of Python"](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)
  describes guidelines for Python code with aphorisms that include:

  - Beautiful is better than ugly.
  
  - Explicit is better than implicit.
  
  - Simple is better than complex.
  
  - Complex is better than complicated.

--

  - Readability counts.
  
  - If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
  
  - There should be one &amp;ndash;and preferably only one&amp;ndash; obvious way
    to do it.

&lt;br&gt;

- The last point relates to the notion of "Pythonic" code that follows these
  and other [style guidelines](https://pep8.org/).

---

## Python versus Perl custom function &lt;br&gt; to calculate the average of a series of numbers

- Python:

  ```python
  def avg(data):
      if len(data) == 0:
        return 0
      else:
        return sum(data) / len(data)
  print(avg([1,2,3,4,5]))
  ```

- Perl:

  ```perl
  sub avg(@_) {
      $sum += $_ foreach @_;
      return $sum / @_ unless @_ == 0;
      return 0;
  }
  print avg((1..5))."\n";
  ```
  
---

## Why Python?

- Good language for new programmers due to its straightforward,
  highly readable style.

- Highly flexible, with e.g. good support for
  *object-oriented* and *functional* programming styles.

- Lot of built-in features that would require third-party libraries in other
  languages.
  
- Excellent availability of third-party libraries.

- Cross-platform, open source, and very popular.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

---

## Usage of Python

Some of the most common broad usage categories for Python are:

- Data science &amp;ndash; especially machine learning

- Engineering, astronomy, biology &amp; bioinformatics

- Web development

- Electronics

- Software like the Dropbox client, games, movies, ...

&lt;br&gt;

--

For instance, it is:

- One of the 4 official languages of Google (along with Java, C++, and Go)

- Tightly integrated with Linux, e.g. Ubuntu Linux prefers community
  contributions to be in Python.

---

## Where to write and run Python code

**We will be working with Python in VS Code**, because:

- VS Code has very good Python support.
  
- This way, you don't have to learn a new environment along with a new language.

---

## Where to write and run Python code

- An even more common way to run Python interactively is with  
  *Jupyter Notebooks* / *JupyterLab*.
  
  - Jupyter Notebooks combine code with
    prose in Markdown format, and can be run in OSC OnDemand as Interactive Apps.

  - You can also run full-fledged Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code.

  .content-box-info[
  The "Python Interactive" window we will use in VS Code in fact also uses the
  Jupyter infrastructure, so you will see annotations like "*Jupyter Server: local*".
  ]

--

- Finally, there are also IDEs (Integrative Development Environment) similar to
  RStudio for Python &amp;ndash; most popular are *PyCharm* and *Spyder*.

--

.content-box-diy[
I would recommend to start following along in VS Code,
but if you're not a fan, feel free to explore other environments &amp;ndash;
and even within the course you should be able to switch to another one.
]

---
name: setup

## Python setup in VS Code

- Open a terminal inside VS Code and start an interactive session:

  ```sh
  sinteractive -A PAS1855 -t 60
  ```

- Load the OSC Conda module,
  create a new Conda environment with Python 3.9,
  activate it, and install `notebook` and `pylint` into it:
  
  ```sh
  module load python/3.6-conda5.2
  conda create -y -n ipy-env -c conda-forge python=3.9
  source activate ipy-env
  conda install -y -c conda-forge -y notebook pylint
  ```
  
  The Conda installation should take a while and in the mean time you can do this
  next step:
  
- Click on the `Extensions` icon in the VS Code Activity Bar
  (the far left, narrow side bar).
  In the Extensions side bar's search box, type "Python".
  
  Then, click on the `Install` button for what should be the top hit, which is
  simply called `Python` (by `ms-python`, 14.9 M downloads).
  
---

## Python setup in VS Code (cont.)

- In the command palette (&lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;P&lt;/kbd&gt;),
  start typing "interpreter" and then select
  `Python: Select Interpreter to Start Jupyter Server`.
  
  Find the Conda environment you just created
  (`Python 3.9.2 64-bit (ipy-env: conda)`) and click on it.

- In the narrow bar all the way at the bottom,
  there should now be a Python environment specification.
  
  If it is not the one you selected above, but e.g. `Python 3.6.8 64-bit`,
  click on that, and *again select the Python 3.9.2 Conda environment*.
  
  Now, the bottom bar should display the Python 3.9.2 environment. 

- Open the command palette again (&lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;P&lt;/kbd&gt;),
  type "interactive", and select `Python: Show Python Interactive Window`.
  
  If it worked, you should have a "Python Interactive" window including 
  a pale blue panel at the bottom, which says *"Type code here and press
  shift-enter to run"*.

# 3.3. Getting started with Python

-----

&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

---

## Simple calculations

- We can use Python as an oversized calculator:

  ```py
  3 + 3         # Addition
  #&gt; 6
  3 * 3         # Multiplication
  #&gt; 9
  3 / 2         # Division
  #&gt; 1.5
  ```

--

- The usual precedence rules apply,
  but it's better to be explicit with parentheses:

  ```py
  2 * 3 ** 3    # Read as 2*(3**3)
  #&gt; 54
  
  2 * (3 ** 3)
  #&gt; 54
  
  (2 * 3) ** 3
  #&gt; 216
  ```

---

## Simple calculations (cont.)

- **Integer division** (AKA floor division) is division in which the
  fractional part (remainder) is discarded:

  ```py
  5 // 2
  #&gt; 2
  ```

&lt;br&gt;

- **The modulo operator** returns the remainder of an integer division:

  ```py
  5 % 2
  #&gt; 1
  ```
  
  _(As 5 = (2*2) + 1), 1 is the remainder of the integer division 5//2.)_
  

--

&lt;br&gt;

.content-box-info[
Like in Bash and other languages, anything after a pound sign `#` is ignored
by Python and generally functions as a "comment".
]

---

## Logical operators: `True`, and `False`

- Logical operators return a Boolean value,
  which in Python consist of `True` and `False` (with that exact case):
  
  ```py
  2 &gt; 3    # Larger than
  #&gt; False
  
  2 == 2   # Equals
  #&gt; True
  
  2 != 2   # Does not equal
  #&gt; False
  ```

---

## Quoting defines strings

- Quotes define strings, and you can single, double, triple-single,
  or triple-double quotes &amp;ndash; but always make sure to use the same closing
  quote as the opening quote.

  ```py
  'my string'
  "my string"
  '''my string'''
  """my string"""
  #&gt; 'my string'
  ```

--

- Being able to use single versus double quotes helps if your string contains
  one of those:
  
  ```py
  "The tree's height"
  #&gt; 'The tree's height'
  ```
  
- And triple quotes are useful if your string contains both single and double quotes:  
  
  ```py
  """The tree's height is 6'2"."""
  #&gt; 'The tree\'s height is 6\'2".'
  ```

---

## Variable assignment

From working with Bash,
we are familiar with the process of assigning variables (also known as
"declaring variables") and then using them.  

- This works the same in Python, but when recalling a variable,
  we don't need any special syntax (like `$` in Bash):

  ```py
  x = 5
  x
  #&gt; 5
  ```

--

- Like in Bash, we can use variables to perform further calculations &amp;ndash;  
  they will simply be replaced by whatever value they hold:
  
  ```py
  x + 3
  #&gt; 8
  y = 8
  x + y
  #&gt; 13
  ```

.content-box-info[
Python is not sensitive to spaces around the `=` for assignment. 
]

---

## Variable assignment (cont.)

- When we assign a simple variable like a number or a string to a *new* variable,
  **a new object is created**, and the two are *not* linked:
  
  ```py
  x
  #&gt; 5
  y = x
  y
  #&gt; 5
  
  y = y + 10
  y
  #&gt; 15
  x
  #&gt; 5
  ```

--

.content-box-info[
This behavior of "unlinked variables" may be very intuitive or expected &amp;ndash;
but in Python, this is only true for *immutable* objects!

We will see examples of *mutable* objects on Thursday, such as *lists*.
]

---

## Variable types

- Unlike in Bash, variables in Python have *types*, such as:
  
  - `int` &amp;ndash; Integer (whole number)
  
  - `float` &amp;ndash; Floating point number (number with decimal points)
  
  - `str` &amp;ndash; String
  
  - `bool` &amp;ndash; Boolean (`True` or `False`)

--

- Python types variables *dynamically* (also known as "duck typing").

  This means you don't have to a priori define what type a variable should be.
  You can check *what Python has decided for you* using `type()`:

  ```py
  x = 2
  type(x)
  #&gt; int
  
  x = "two"
  type(x)
  #&gt; str
  ```

---

## Setup for Thursday

- **In the OnDemand form for VS Code, set the Working Directory to
  `/fs/ess/PAS1855/users/&lt;your-username&gt;`.**

- In the command palette (&lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;P&lt;/kbd&gt;),
  start typing "interpreter" and then select
  **`Python: Select Interpreter to Start Jupyter Server`**.
  
- Find the Conda environment you created on Tuesday
  (should be: `Python 3.9.2 64-bit (ipy-env: conda)`) and click on it.

- If the Python version in the narrow bar at the bottom is not the
  one you selected, click on it, and *again select the Conda Python 3.9.2 environment*.
  
- Open the command palette again (&lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;P&lt;/kbd&gt;),
  type "interactive", and select **`Python: Show Python Interactive Window`**.
  
.content-box-info[
Is this doesn't work, we can troubleshoot after class again &amp;ndash;
for now, open a terminal in VS Code and start a regular Python prompt with:

```sh
$ python3
```
]

---

## Variable types (cont.)

- We can combine variables of the same type using operators like `+` and `*`.
  We already saw this for numbers, but we can do the same for string:
  
- Assign a string, and concatenate strings with `+`:

  ```py
  x = "The cell grew"
  
  x + " and is now larger"
  #&gt; 'The cell grew and is now larger'
  ```

--

- This doesn't work with variables of different types:

  ```py
  # x = "The cell grew"
  # y = 15
  
  x + y
  #&gt; ---------------------------------------------
  #&gt; TypeError
  #&gt; Traceback (most recent call last)
  #&gt; &lt;ipython-input-8-b50c5120e24b&gt; in &lt;module&gt;()
  #&gt; ----&gt; 1 x + y
  #&gt; TypeError: Can't convert ' int ' object to str implicitly
  ```

---

## Variable types (cont.)

- But we can convert variable types on the fly; to as string with `str()`:
  
  ```py
  # x = "The cell grew"
  # y = 15

  x + " " + str(y) + " nm"
  #&gt; 'The cell grew 8 nm'
  ```

--

- To an integer with `int()`:

  ```py
  z = "81"
  y + int(z)
  #&gt; 96
  ```

- And conversion to a floating point number or a Boolean is done with `float()`   and `bool()`, respectively.
  
.content-box-info[
Note that quotes always denote strings,
so numbers in quotes, like `z` above, are interpreted as strings.
]
  
---

## Naming Python variables

- Use only alphanumeric characters and underscores in variables names.

- Numbers can't be used as the *first character* in variable names.

- To delimit words, preferably use underscores (`my_variable`) rather than
  "camel case" (`MyVariable`).
  (And note that Python is case-sensitive.)

- As we'll see in a minute, periods `.` have special meaning in Python and
  **can not** be used in variable names.

---

## Python variables

.content-box-info[
To see which variables are in your environment, the VS Code interactive window
has a nice feature at the top of the window:
`Show variables active in Jupyter kernel`.

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src=img/vscode-py-vars.png width="75%"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src=img/vscode-py-vars2.png width="75%"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
]

---

## Built-in functions

- In the previous slides, we saw several examples of *functions*,
  like `str()`, which are called using parentheses:
  
  ```py
  # With no arguments specified:
  function_name()
  # With arguments specified:
  function_name(function_argument1, function_argument2)
  ```

--

- Another example is `len()`, which gets the length of (e.g.) a string:

  ```py
  s = "a long string"
  len(s)
  #&gt; 13
  ```

--

- Or `round()`, to round a number,
  with an optional number of decimals to round to (the default is 0):

  ```py
  round(3.14159)
  #&gt; 3
  round(3.14159, 3)
  #&gt; 3.142
  ```

---

## Printing to screen

.content-box-info[
As we've seen, when we typed `x` or `x + y`, the outcome was printed to screen.

However, this only happens when we run Python code *interactively*.

To be more explicit, and to print in any context,
we can use the function `print()`:

```py
print(x)
#&gt; 2
print(z)
#&gt; '88'
```
]

---

## Strings and methods

- **Python is "object-oriented"** &amp;ndash;
  its variables are objects that contain:
  
  - The values/data assigned to them, _and_
  
  - A type of functions specifically associated with the object type.  
    These are called **"methods"**.
  
  - Methods are used with syntax `&lt;object_name&gt;.&lt;method_name&gt;()`
    instead of `&lt;method_name&gt;(object_name)`.
    
--

&lt;br&gt;

- Let's call our first method &amp;mdash; we'll try `find()`,
  which prints the position of the first occurrence of a substring:
  
  ```py
  astring = "ATGCATG"
  astring.find("C")
  #&gt; 3
  ```

---

## Getting help

- To see which methods are associated with any object,
  type its name followed by a period `.` and a list of available methods will
  appear. For instance, for our string `astring`, type:
  
  ```py
  astring.
  ```
  
  &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;p align="center"&gt;
  &lt;img src=img/show-methods.png width="75%"&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  
---

## Getting help (cont.)

- To get help about methods/objects, you can use:

  ```py  
  # Help for a method:
  astring.find?   # or "?astring.find" or "help(atring.find)"
  
  # Help for an object, given its type:
  astring?        # or ?astring
  ```

  &lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;p align="center"&gt;
  &lt;img src=img/method-doc.png width="85%"&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

- On the internet, &lt;https://docs.python.org&gt; should be your go-to source
  besides Google.

---

## *Methods* versus (generic) *functions*

.content-box-info[
- Call the function `print()` on a string:

  ```py
  # astring = "ATGCATG"
  
  print(astring)
  #&gt; ATGCATG
  ```

- Calling the method "print" returns an error message
  that tells us that strings have no method called `print`:

  ```py
  astring.print()
  #&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------
  #&gt; AttributeError: ' str ' object has no attribute ' print '
  ```

---

## More methods for strings

- `count()` to count occurrences of substrings:

  ```py
  astring.count("G")
  #&gt; 2
  ```

&lt;br&gt;

- `.replace()` to replace substrings:
  
  ```py
  # astring = "ATGCATG"
  
  astring.replace("T", "U")
  #&gt; 'AUGCAUG'
  ```

--

.content-box-q[
Has `astring` been modified by our `astring.replace()` call?
]

---

## More methods for strings

- `.strip()` to remove, by default, leading and trailing white space:

  ```py
  newstring = " Mus musculus "  # Note the spaces before and after
  
  newstring.strip()
  #&gt; 'Mus musculus'
  ```
  
&lt;br&gt;

- `.split()` will split a string into components, using spaces by default:

  ```py
  newstring.split()
  #&gt; ['Mus', 'musculus']
  
  # Specify the character by which to split:
  newstring.split("u")
  #&gt; ['M', 's m', 'sc', 'l', 's']
  ```

&lt;br&gt;

---

## Other behavior of methods

- You can even use string methods without first assigning the string to a
  variable:
  
  ```py
  # Make uppercase with `.upper()`:
  "atgc".upper()
  #&gt;'ATGC'
  
  # Make lowercase with `.lower()`:
  "TGCA".lower()
  #&gt; 'tgca'
  ```

--

&lt;br&gt;

- And you can **combine multiple methods** in a single call
  by chaining them together like so:

  ```py
  # astring = "ATGCATG"
  
  astring.replace("T", "U").count("U")
  #&gt; 2
  ```
  
---

## Concatenating strings

- As we saw earlier, we can concatenate strings with the `+` sign:

  ```py
  genus = "Rattus"
  species = "norvegicus"
  
  genus + " " + species    # Separate with a space
  #&gt; 'Rattus norvegicus'   
  ```

--

- But this is a slow way of concatenating &amp;ndash;
  the `.join()` method is better:

  ```py
  # join requires a list of strings as input:
  human = ["Homo", "sapiens"]
  " ".join(human)
  #&gt; 'Homo sapiens'
  
  # You can specify any symbol as a delimiter:
  "-&gt;".join(["one", "leads", "2", "the", "other"])
  #&gt; 'one-&gt;leads-&gt;2-&gt;the-&gt;other'
  ```
  
---

## More on methods

- Different object types have different methods:

  ```py
  my_int = 8
  my_int.               # See methods for integers 
  
  my_float = 8.5
  float.                # See methods for floats
  
  mystring = "ATGC"
  my.string.            # See methods for strings
  ```

## <i class="fas  fa-user-edit "></i> Intermezzo 3.1

1. Initialize the string `s = "WHEN on board H.M.S. Beagle, as naturalist"`.

2. Apply a string method to count the number of occurrences of the
   character `b`.

3. Modify the command such that it counts both lowercase and uppercase `b`'s.

4. Replace `WHEN` with `When`.
