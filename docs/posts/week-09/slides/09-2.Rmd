## Getting set up

1. In VS Code, open an existing Python script for this week or start a new one
   (`.py` extension) and trigger or directly start the Interactive Window.

3. Look for your `CSB` dir (the book's GitHub repo) or download it again
   in the shell:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB.git
  ```

4. Assuming your CSB dir is at `/fs/ess/PAS1855/users/$USER/CSB`,  
   and your Python script in `/fs/ess/PAS1855/users/$USER/week09`,  
   move to the `python/sandbox` dir in CSB using: 

  ```py
  import os
  os.chdir('../CSB/python/sandbox')
  
  ## Or with:
  # os.chdir('/fs/ess/PAS1855/users/<username>/CSB/python/sandbox')
  
  ## Check your current working dir:
  # os.getcwd()
  ```

## CSB 3.7: Working with files

We need to explicitly open a file before we can interact with it.
Opening a file won't load it into memory, but will create a connection to the file.

For instance, to open a file for *writing* (`w`):

```python
myfile = open("my_new_file", "w")
```

Now, `myfile` is is a file object, also called a *file handle*.

<br>

--

.pull-left[
| Shorthand | File mode
|-----------|----------
| `r`       | Read
| `w`       | Write
| `a`       | Append
| `r+`       | Read + write
]

---

## File object attributes

We can see which attributes and methods are associated with our file object
as usual, by typing a period after the object name:

```python
myfile.
```

<br>

Let's look at some of these attributes &ndash;
the file name, mode, and encoding:

```python
myfile.name
# 'my_new_file'

myfile.mode
# 'w'

myfile.encoding
'UTF-8'
```

---

## Writing to a file

To actually write to a file, we can use the `write()` method to write a string
to the file, or `writelines()` to write a list to the file.

- However, in either case, we need to insert the newlines ourselves with `\n`:  

  ```python
  s = 'My file contents'
  
  myfile.write(s + "\n")
  myfile.writelines(["A\n", "B\n", "C\n"])
  ```

  (`writelines()` is not therefore not the clearest name.)

--

- When we are done with the file, we need to close it:

  ```python
  myfile.close()
  ```

.content-box-info[
To write a list to file one line at a time, use `join()`:
```py
f.write("\n".join(mylist))
```
]

---

## A more convenient way: `with open()`

- If we use the `with open()` construct,
  we don't have to manually close the file &ndash;
  instead, we use *indentation* to indicate that the file connection is open:
  
  ```python
  with open("my_new_file", "r") as my_file:    
    
        for my_line in my_file:
            print(my_line)
  
  #> My file contents
  #>
  #> A
  #>
  #> B
  #>
  #> C
  ```

- The above example also shows that **if we loop over the file handle,
  we automatically process one line at a time.**
  
- Here, simply printed the contents of the file to screen,
  but notice how we ended up with double spacing.

---

## More newlines

- To see what's going on, let's read a single line using `readline()`
  and store the result in a variable.
  
  ```python
  with open('my_new_file', 'r') as input_file:
      
        line1 = input_file.readline()
  
  line1
  #> 'My file contents\n'
  print(line1)
  #> My file contents
  #>
  ```

--

- As it turns out, the reading methods include the newline characters `\n`.

- Additionally, `print()` by default inserts a newline at the end.

- To `print()` or otherwise process a line, we can use `strip()` to remove
  leading and trailing newlines (and other whitespace):
  
  ```py
  line1 = input_file.readline().strip()
  ```

---

## Reading and writing

- As another toy example, we can write the lines that we read from one file
  to another file:

  ```python
  with open('../data/Singh2015_data.csv', 'r') as input_file:
      
      with open('Singh_copy.csv', 'w') as output_file:
        
        for line in input_file:
          output_file.write(line)
  ```

- No, we don't need to think about the `\n` characters,
  because both reading *includes* them and writing "*needs*" them.

---

## Progressively reading a file

- When reading a single line at a time using `readline()`,  
  **reading is done progressively**, so if we call `readline()` twice,
  we will read the first and *then* the second line:
  
  ```python
  with open('../data/Singh2015_data.csv', 'r') as input_file:
      
        line1 = input_file.readline().strip()
        line2 = input_file.readline().strip()
        print(line1)
        print(line2)
  
  #> Line,InfectionStatus,RecombinantFraction
  #> 21,I,0.1826923077
  ```

--

- Or to skip a line, for instance a header, we can use `next()`:

  ```python
  input_file.next()
  ```
  
- To go back to, in this case, the 1st line, we can use:

  ```python
  input_file.seek(0)
  ```
  
---

## Summary of basic options to read from a file

- Note that with all approaches, line breaks are present in the resulting
strings as `\n`.  

| Approach                   | Result           |
|----------------------------|------------------|
| **`for <line> in <file>:`** | Loop over lines one at a time.
| **`readline()`** | Return current line as a string.
| **`readlines()`** | Return a list of strings, one item per line.
| **`read()`** | Return entire file content as a single string.

---

## Character-delimited (tabular) files

We start by reading the first few lines of a CSV (comma-separated values)
file:

```python
with open("../data/Dalziel2016_data.csv") as dalziel_file:
    
    for i, line in enumerate(dalziel_file):
        
        print(line.strip())
        
        if i > 2:
            break

#> biweek,year,loc,cases,pop
#> 1,1906,BALTIMORE,NA,526822.1365
#> 2,1906,BALTIMORE,NA,526995.246
#> 3,1906,BALTIMORE,NA,527170.1981
```

--

- We didn't specify an option to `open()`, so it defaults to *read* mode.

- With `enumerate()`, we can track line numbers along with line contents.

- We break out of the loop, i.e. we stop it from running,
  after we've printed the line with a line index `i` of 3 &ndash;
  the effect is that we only print the first four lines.

---

## Using the `csv` module

While we could manually split rows by commas,
a "module" that can do this for us is `csv`,
which we load using an `import` statement (more next week): 

```python
import csv

with open("../data/Dalziel2016_data.csv") as dalziel_file:
    
    # We use the function "reader" from the csv module;
    # Note the csv.reader = <module>.<function> syntax
    reader = csv.reader(dalziel_file)
    
    for i, row in enumerate(reader):
        print(row)
        if i > 2:
            break

#> ['biweek', 'year', 'loc', 'cases', 'pop']
#> ['1', '1906', 'BALTIMORE', 'NA', '526822.1365']
#> ['2', '1906', 'BALTIMORE', 'NA', '526995.246']
#> ['3', '1906', 'BALTIMORE', 'NA', '527170.1981']
```

The output is a list for every row, with one item per field.

---

## Using the `csv` module (cont.)

The `csv.DictReader()` function will return a *dictionary* for every row,
containing the *column names as the keys* and the cell values as the values:

```python
with open("../data/Dalziel2016_data.csv") as dalziel_file:
    
    reader = csv.DictReader(dalziel_file)
    
    for i, row in enumerate(reader):
        print(dict(row))
        
        if i > 2:
            break
    
#> {'biweek': '1', 'year': '1906', 'loc': 'BALTIMORE', 'cases': 'NA', 'pop': '526822.1365'}
#> {'biweek': '2', 'year': '1906', 'loc': 'BALTIMORE', 'cases': 'NA', 'pop': '526995.246'}
#> {'biweek': '3', 'year': '1906', 'loc': 'BALTIMORE', 'cases': 'NA', 'pop': '527170.1981'}
#> {'biweek': '4', 'year': '1906', 'loc': 'BALTIMORE', 'cases': 'NA', 'pop': '527347.0136'}
```

---

## Using the `csv` module (cont.)

Now, we can easily select rows based on their values in a specific column.

For instance, to take only rows from Washington &ndash;
i.e. where the column `loc` has the value "Washington":

```sh
with open("../data/Dalziel2016_data.csv") as infile:
    
    reader = csv.DictReader(infile)

    for row in reader:
        if row['loc'] == "WASHINGTON":
            print(row)
            
#> {'biweek': '14', 'year': '1940', 'loc': 'WASHINGTON', 'cases': '3', 'pop': '672643.7152'}
#> {'biweek': '15', 'year': '1940', 'loc': 'WASHINGTON', 'cases': '3', 'pop': '673370.2202'}
#> {'biweek': '16', 'year': '1940', 'loc': 'WASHINGTON', 'cases': '3', 'pop': '674095.5105'}         
#> ...
```

---

## Using the `csv` module (cont.)

Next, let's write the rows for Washington to a new, tab-delimited file:

```python
with open("../data/Dalziel2016_data.csv") as infile:
    
    reader = csv.DictReader(infile)
    
    with open('Dalziel_Washington.csv', "w") as outfile:
        
        writer = csv.DictWriter(outfile,
                                fieldnames = reader.fieldnames,
                                delimiter = '\t')
        
        writer.writeheader()   # Write the header row

        for row in reader:
            if row['loc'] == "WASHINGTON":
                writer.writerow(row)
```

## `r icon::fa("user-edit")` Intermezzo 3.4

Write code that prints (`print()`) the values in the columns `loc` and `pop`
for all rows in the file `Dalziel2016_data.csv`.
