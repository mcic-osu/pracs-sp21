## Getting set up

1. In VS Code, open an existing Python script for this week or start a new one
   (`.py` extension).

3. Look for your `CSB` dir (the book's GitHub repo) or download it again
   in the shell:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/CSB-book/CSB.git
  ```

4. Assuming your CSB dir is at `/fs/ess/PAS1855/users/$USER/CSB`,
   and your Python script in `/fs/ess/PAS1855/users/$USER/week09`,
   move to a dir in CSB in Python using: 

  ```py
  import os
  os.chdir('../CSB/python/sandbox')
  
  ## Or with:
  # os.chdir('/fs/ess/PAS1855/users/<username>/CSB/python/sandbox')
  
  ## Check your current working dir:
  # os.getcwd()
  ```

## CSB 3.7: Working with files

We need to explicitly open a file before we can interact with it.
Opening a file won't load it into memory, but will create a connection to the file.

For instance, to open a file for *writing*:

```python
myfile = open("mytextfile", "w")
```

--

| Shorthand | File mode
|-----------|----------
| `r`       | Read
| `w`       | Write
| `a`       | Append
| `r+`       | Read + write

--

Now, `f` is is a file object, also called a *file handle*.
We can see which attributes and methods are associated with our file object
as usual, by typing a period after the object name:

```python
myfile.
```
---

## File object attributes

Let's look at some of these attributes &ndash;
the file name, mode, and encoding:

```python
myfile.name
# 'Singh2015_data.csv'

myfile.mode
# 'w'

myfile.encoding
'UTF-8'
```

---

## Writing to a file

With the `write()` method, we write a string to the file,
and with `writelines()`, we write a list to the file.

However, in either case, we need to insert the newlines ourselves with `\n` (so `writelines()` is not the clearest name):  

```python
myfile.write(s + "\n")
myfile.writelines(["A\n", "B\n", "C\n"])
```

When we are done with the file, we need to close it:

```python
myfile.close()
```

--

<br>

.content-box-info[
To write a list to file one line at a time, we can use `join()`:
```py
f.write("\n".join(mylist))
```
]

---

## A more convenient way: `with open()`

- If we instead use the `with open()` construct, we don't have to manually
  close the file, instead we use indentation to indicate when we have the file
  open:
  
  ```python
  with open("Singh2015_data.csv", "r") as singh_file:    
    
      for my_line in singh_file:
        print(my_line)
  ```

- The above example also shows that if we loop over the file handle,
  we can process one line at a time.
  
  Here, we are simply printing the contents of the file to screen.

---

## Reading and writing

- As another toy example, we can write the lines that we read from one file
  to another file:

  ```python
  with open('Singh2015_data.csv', 'r') as input_file:
      
      with open( 'Singh_copy.csv', 'w') as output_file:
        
        for line in input_file:
          output_file.write(line)
  ```

---

## Progressively reading a file

- To read a single line at a time, using `readline()`.  
  **Reading is done progressively**, so if we call `readline()` twice,
  we will read the first and then the second line:
  
  ```python
  with open('Singh2015_data.csv', 'r') as input_file:
      line1 = input_file.readline()
      line2 = input_file.readline()
      print(line1)
      print(line2)
  
  #> Line,InfectionStatus,RecombinantFraction
  #> 21,I,0.1826923077
  ```

--

- Or to skip a line, for instance a header, we can use `next()`:

  ```python
  input_file.next()
  ```
  
- To go back to, in this case, the 1st line, we can use:

  ```python
  input_file.seek(0)
  ```
  
---

## Summary of basic options to read from a file

- **`for my_line in my_filehandle:`**  &mdash; Loop over lines one at a time

- **`readline()`** &mdash; Return current line as a string ending with `\n`.
 
- **`readlines()`** &mdash; Return a list of strings, one item per line.

- **`read()`** &mdash; Return entire file content as a single string.

---

## Character-delimited (tabular) files

We start by reading the first few lines of a CSV (comma-separated values)
file:

```python
with open("Dalziel2016_data.csv") as dalziel_file:
    
    for i, line in enumerate(dalziel_file):
        
        print(line.strip())
        
        if i > 2:
            break

#> biweek,year,loc,cases,pop
#> 1,1906,BALTIMORE,NA,526822.1365
#> 2,1906,BALTIMORE,NA,526995.246
#> 3,1906,BALTIMORE,NA,527170.1981
```

- We didn't specify an option to `open()`, so it defaults to *read* mode.

- With `enumerate()`, we can track line numbers along with line contents.

- We break out of (stop) the loop when we've reached an `i` (line index)
  of 3, meaning that we only print the first three lines.

---

## Using the `csv` module

While we could manually split rows by commas,
a "module" that can do this for us is `csv`,
which we load using an `import` statement (more next week): 

```python
import csv

with open("Dalziel2016_data.csv") as dalziel_file:
    
    # We use the function "reader" from the csv module;
    # Note the csv.reader = <module>.<function> syntax
    reader = csv.reader(dalziel_file)
    
    for i, row in enumerate(reader):
        print(row)
        if i > 2:
            break

#> ['biweek', 'year', 'loc', 'cases', 'pop']
#> ['1', '1906', 'BALTIMORE', 'NA', '526822.1365']
#> ['2', '1906', 'BALTIMORE', 'NA', '526995.246']
#> ['3', '1906', 'BALTIMORE', 'NA', '527170.1981']
```

The output is a list for every row, with one item per field.

---

## Using the `csv` module (cont.)

We can also use the `csv.DictReader()` function which will return a *dictionary*
for every row:

```python
with open("Dalziel2016_data.csv") as dalziel_file:
    
    reader = csv.DictReader(dalziel_file)
    
    for i, row in enumerate(reader):
        print(dict(row))
        
        if i > 2:
            break
    
#> {'biweek': '1', 'year': '1906', 'loc': 'BALTIMORE', 'cases': 'NA', 'pop': '526822.1365'}
#> {'biweek': '2', 'year': '1906', 'loc': 'BALTIMORE', 'cases': 'NA', 'pop': '526995.246'}
#> {'biweek': '3', 'year': '1906', 'loc': 'BALTIMORE', 'cases': 'NA', 'pop': '527170.1981'}
#> {'biweek': '4', 'year': '1906', 'loc': 'BALTIMORE', 'cases': 'NA', 'pop': '527347.0136'}
```

## Using the `csv` module (cont.)

Now, we can easily select rows based on their values.

For instance, to take only rows from Washington,
i.e. where the column `loc` has the value "Washington":

```sh
with open("../data/Dalziel2016_data.csv") as infile:
    
    reader = csv.DictReader(infile)

        for row in reader:
            if row['loc'] == "WASHINGTON":
                print(row)
```

---

## Using the `csv` module (cont.)

Next, let's write the Washington rows to a new, tab-delimited file:

```python
with open("../data/Dalziel2016_data.csv") as infile:
    
    reader = csv.DictReader(infile)
    
    header = reader.fieldnames # Get the header row
    
    with open('Dalziel_Washington.csv', "w") as outfile:
        
        writer = csv.DictWriter(outfile, fieldnames=header,
                                delimiter = '\t')
        writer.writeheader()   # Write the header row

        for row in reader:
            if row['loc'] == "WASHINGTON":
                writer.writerow(row)
```

## `r icon::fa("user-edit")` Intermezzo 3.4

Write code that print the values in the columns `loc` and `pop` for all the rows
in the file `Dalziel2016_data.csv`

---

## `r icon::fa("user-edit")` Intermezzo 3.4: solutions

```py
import csv

with open ("../data/Dalziel2016_data.csv") as f:
  
  reader = csv.DictReader(f)
  
  for row in reader:
    print(row["loc"], row["pop"])
```

--

<br>

Or to write this to a file:

```py
with open("../data/Dalziel2016_data.csv") as infile:

    reader = csv.DictReader(infile)

    with open('Dalziel_loc-pop.csv', "w") as outfile:

        for row in reader:
            outfile.write(str(row['loc'] + ',' + row['pop'] + '\n'))
```
