## General information about your final project


### Devising a project

I recommend that you make your final project as useful as possible for your own
research and/or personal development.

For instance, you may want to work with your own data or a publicly
available dataset that is similar to what you are expecting to work with
(though subsetting the data will be useful if you have a large genomic dataset!).
You may also decide that just focusing on the coding and on creating a reproducible
workflow is the most useful for you, and that this may be easier with a small
dummy dataset so you don't get bogged down in other details.
Finally, perhaps you can think of trying to automate something "boring" that you
so far did manually. 

If you come up empty-handed, talk to Zach about his fungal genomics database and
associated project ideas.

If that also doesn't float your boat, talk to me and I can help you with a dataset
and/or project idea.

### Requirements

Requirements for your project focus on **appropriate usage of many of the
tools and principles we covered during the course**.

Accordingly, there are no real requirements about the level of complexity
or sophistication, the number of scripts, the real-world usefulness, and so on,
of your project. In fact, I would recommend that you take care not
to be too ambitious in this regard such that you may not end up having time to
create proper documentation and ensure reproducibility.

The project should:

- Be well-organized: contained in a single parent directory with a clear and
  sensible structure of subdirectories, descriptive file and directory names,
  no files floating around whose purpose or source is not clear, and so on.

- Be well-documented with at least one README in Markdown format in the root
  directory of your project

- Be version-controlled *throughout* (i.e. with regular, meaningful commits),
  and repeatedly "pushed" to GitHub.

- Have (most) analysis or data processing done using scripts in Bash and/or Python.
  
  - Some components in other languages such as R are fine, too,
    in case you know how to do things there that we didn't learn in the course
    (for example, plotting in R -- we only cover minimal basics of plotting in Python).
    
  - Similarly, it is okay to call external, command-line programs
    (e.g. some of the bioinformatics programs we have run, or any program
    that may be useful for your research).
    
    If your project is *mostly* or almost entirely calling such programs, though,
    I would like you to especially focus on creating
    a reproducible and easily rerunnable pipeline (see below).
  
- Run one or more of the scripts as SLURM jobs at OSC.
  (But a locally run project *could* be okay if your research does not and will not
  require the use of supercomputers like those at OSC -- check in with me if this
  is the case and you would prefer not to use OSC.)

- Be easily re-runnable using a "master" / "controller" script that glues the
  entire project together.
  
  A `README.md` that explains what you did or provides
  instructions how to rerun the project, even if in detail
  ("Next, I ran script C using the command `my_script.py arg1 arg2`"),
  is not enough: there should be a script that can actually be run,
  for instance by me!
  
  Preferably, this is done using single Snakemake control script ("Snakefile").
