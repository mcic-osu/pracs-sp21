**The submission of your final project is due on April 30th.** <i>[20
points]</i>

### How to submit

As usual, open a new GitHub issue for your repository and tag `@jelmerp`
in the text body of the Issue.

### What to submit

Your repository should now contain:

-   **A finished set of scripts**.

-   **Final documentation** in one or more README files that clearly
    describes:

    -   What the project does as a whole.
    -   What each script does.
    -   Where to access the data at OSC, assuming that the data is not
        in your repository.
    -   How the project's scripts can be rerun using a single
        (workflow/"driver") script or Snakefile.

-   **A single (workflow/"driver" script) or Snakefile that aim to rerun
    the full workflow.**

-   **A file (e.g. `submission_notes.md`) or a section in your main
    README file** that provides some information for the instructor to
    grade your project appropriately, such as (all hypothetical
    examples):

    -   Additional instructions the instructor will need to try and
        rerun your project.

    -   You want to alert the instructor to some files files in the
        repository that should be ignored.

    -   You want to explain why you don't have a functioning
        workflow/"driver" script or Snakefile, or why you didn't run any
        SLURM jobs.

    -   You had some messy commits that you feel should be excused.

### Graded aspects

+================+===============+====================================+
| Project        | 2             | -   Has a clear and appropriate    |
| organization   |               |     directory structure.           |
|                |               | -   Has informative and            |

|                |               |     directories.                   |
+----------------+---------------+------------------------------------+
| Project        | 2             | -   Has a clear description of its |
| background and |               |     background and goals.          |
| documentation  |               | -   Has a clear description of how |
|                |               |     different scripts are being    |
|                |               |     used to achieve these goals.   |
|                |               | -   Where appropriate, indicates   |
|                |               |     what is still a                |
|                |               |     work-in-progress.              |
|                |               | -   Where appropriate, indicates   |
|                |               |     future directions.             |
+----------------+---------------+------------------------------------+
| Script         | 2             | -   Uses extensive (yet succinct)  |
| documentation  |               |     comments to document what is   |
|                |               |     being done within scripts.     |
+----------------+---------------+------------------------------------+
| Good practices | 4             | -   Uses no absolute paths in      |
| in scripts     |               |     scripts.                       |
|                |               | -   Uses scripts that take         |
|                |               |     arguments where appropriate    |
|                |               |     (see next point).              |
|                |               | -   Minimizes "hard-coding" of     |
|                |               |     potentially variable things    |
|                |               |     like input/output dirs, file   |
|                |               |     names, and some software       |
|                |               |     settings.                      |
|                |               | -   Any hard-coded                 |
|                |               |     variables/constants that *are* |
|                |               |     present, should be clearly set |
|                |               |     at the top of scripts.         |
|                |               | -   Has individual scripts that    |
|                |               |     are not overly long and don't  |
|                |               |     do multiple unrelated things.  |
|                |               | -   Has no scripts with lines that |
|                |               |     are "commented out" (if you    |
|                |               |     somehow can't get around that, |
|                |               |     clearly annotate such lines).  |
|                |               | -   Uses Bash scripts with proper  |
|                |               |     `set` settings, and similar    |
|                |               |     good practices as taught in    |
|                |               |     the course.                    |
+----------------+---------------+------------------------------------+
| Coding quality | 3             | -   Has code that demonstrates an  |
| and complexity |               |     understanding of some          |
|                |               |     topics/tricks/constructs       |
|                |               |     covered in the course.         |
|                |               | -   Has code that makes sensible   |
|                |               |     choices as taught in the       |
|                |               |     course, e.g. looping over      |
|                |               |     globbing results directly      |
|                |               |     rather than over `ls` output.  |
|                |               | -   Has code that is appropriately |
|                |               |     broken up in small parts       |
|                |               |     within scripts, e.g. with      |
|                |               |     functions in Python.           |
|                |               | -   Uses tools and commands that   |
|                |               |     are (by and large) appropriate |
|                |               |     to accomplish its goals. (I    |
|                |               |     will not dig in to fine        |
|                |               |     details and parameter          |
|                |               |     settings.)                     |
+----------------+---------------+------------------------------------+
| Workflow       | 3             | -   Has a script or Snakefile that |
| r              |               |     includes all steps in the      |
| eproducibility |               |     workflow and that can actually |
|                |               |     be run by anybody who has      |
|                |               |     access to your repository and  |
|                |               |     the raw data files.            |
|                |               | -   Has information for the        |
|                |               |     instructor (or any other       |
|                |               |     reader of the project!) about  |
|                |               |     where at OSC to find the raw   |
|                |               |     data files and other details   |
|                |               |     needed to try to rerun the     |
|                |               |     analyses.                      |
+----------------+---------------+------------------------------------+
| Software       | 1             | -   Uses Conda environments        |
| management     |               |     (preferred) or OSC modules for |
|                |               |     any software that is needed in |
|                |               |     the workflow.                  |
|                |               | -   Does not use manual            |
|                |               |     installations and if Conda     |
|                |               |     packages or OSC modules are    |
|                |               |     available for a given          |

|                |               | -   Bonus: has YAML files that     |
|                |               |     describe the Conda             |

| OSC            |               |     are run as OSC jobs at SLURM.  |
|                |               | -   Uses appropriate SLURM         |
|                |               |     directives -- either in the    |
|                |               |     scripts or in a Snakemake      |
|                |               |     profile YAML file.             |

|                |               |     commits don't consist of       |
|                |               |     multiple completely unrelated  |

### Questions and advice

Don't hesitate to contact Jelmer (or, where fitting, Zach) for questions
about topcis like:

-   Specific expectations for the final project that are unclear to you.
-   Whether you are on the right track in making some adjustments that I
    asked for after your progress report.
-   Advice on how to code or organize aspects of your project.

### Late submissions

Late submission may be accommodated depending on circumstances, but you
will need to contact me *before 3 pm on April 30th* -- and we can take
it from there. If I have not received a submission nor have we reached
an agreement on a late submission by the end of the day, 4 points will
be subtracted for each day the submission is late. (But things like
forgetting to open an Issue won't lead to subtracted points.)

### Good luck!!
