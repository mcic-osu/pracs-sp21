**The submission of your final project is due on April 30th.** <i>[20
points]</i>

### How to submit

As usual, open a new GitHub issue for your repository and tag `@jelmerp`
in the text body of the Issue.

### What to submit

Your repository should now contain:

-   **A finished set of scripts**.

-   **Final documentation** in one or more README files that clearly
    describes:

    -   What the project does as a whole.
    -   What each script does.
    -   Where to access the data at OSC, assuming that the data is not
        in your repository.
    -   How the project's scripts can be rerun using a single script or
        Snakefile.

-   **A single script or Snakefile that aims to rerun the full
    workflow.**

-   A file (e.g. `submission_notes.md`) or a section in your main README
    file that provides some **additional information for the instructor
    to grade your project appropriately**. Some hypothetical examples of
    things you may want to include:

    -   Additional instructions the instructor will need to try and
        rerun your project.

    -   You want to alert the instructor to some files files in the
        repository that should be ignored.

    -   You want to explain why you don't have a functioning script or
        Snakefile, or why you didn't run any SLURM jobs (which can be
        acceptable in some cases).

### Graded aspects

Below is a long list of graded aspects and what to aim for if you want a
perfect score. (See also the [General Info](final_project.html) page for
the final project for some more general background.)

+-------------+----------+--------------------------------------------+
| Category    | Max.     | Max. score if your project (examples       |
|             | score    | given):                                    |
+=============+==========+============================================+
| Project o   | 2        | -   Has a clear and appropriate directory  |
| rganization |          |     structure.                             |
|             |          | -   Has informative and appropriate        |
|             |          |     directory and file names.              |
|             |          | -   Does not mix data, scripts, and        |
|             |          |     results in individual directories.     |
+-------------+----------+--------------------------------------------+
| Project     | 2        | -   Has a clear description of its         |
| background  |          |     background and goals.                  |
| and do      |          | -   Has a clear description of how         |
| cumentation |          |     different scripts are being used to    |
|             |          |     achieve these goals.                   |
|             |          | -   Where appropriate, indicates what is   |
|             |          |     still a work-in-progress (and          |
|             |          |     optionally future directions).         |
+-------------+----------+--------------------------------------------+
| Script do   | 2        | -   Uses extensive (yet succinct) comments |
| cumentation |          |     to document what is being done within  |
|             |          |     scripts.                               |
+-------------+----------+--------------------------------------------+
| Good        | 4        | -   Uses no absolute paths in scripts.     |
| practices   |          | -   Uses scripts that take arguments where |
| in scripts  |          |     appropriate and minimizes              |
|             |          |     "hard-coding" of potentially variable  |
|             |          |     things like input/output dirs, file    |
|             |          |     names, and some software settings. Any |
|             |          |     hard-coded variables/constants that    |
|             |          |     *are* present are clearly set at the   |
|             |          |     top of scripts.                        |
|             |          | -   Has individual scripts that are not    |
|             |          |     overly long and don't do multiple      |
|             |          |     unrelated things.                      |
|             |          | -   Has no or only clearly annotated lines |
|             |          |     that are "commented out" in scripts.   |
|             |          | -   Uses Bash scripts with proper `set`    |
|             |          |     settings, and similar good practices   |
|             |          |     as taught in the course.               |
+-------------+----------+--------------------------------------------+
| Coding      | 3        | -   Has code that demonstrates an          |
| quality and |          |     understanding of topics covered in the |
| complexity  |          |     course.                                |
|             |          | -   Has code that is appropriately broken  |
|             |          |     up in small parts within scripts, e.g. |
|             |          |     with functions in Python.              |
|             |          | -   Uses tools and commands that are (by   |
|             |          |     and large) appropriate to accomplish   |
|             |          |     its goals. (I will not dig in to fine  |
|             |          |     details and parameter settings.)       |
+-------------+----------+--------------------------------------------+
| Workflow    | 3        | -   Has a script or Snakefile that         |
| <br>        |          |     includes all steps in the workflow and |
| repr        |          |     that can be run by anybody with access |
| oducibility |          |     to your repository and the raw data    |
|             |          |     files.                                 |
|             |          | -   Has information for the instructor (or |
|             |          |     any other reader of the project!)      |
|             |          |     about where at OSC to find the raw     |
|             |          |     data files and other details needed to |
|             |          |     try to rerun the analyses.             |
|             |          | -   *Bonus:* good software management,     |
|             |          |     e.g. Conda environments (preferred) or |
|             |          |     OSC modules and no manual installs     |
|             |          |     unless necessary; YAML files           |
|             |          |     describing environments.               |
+-------------+----------+--------------------------------------------+
| SLURM jobs  | 2        | -   Has one or more scripts that are run   |
| at OSC      |          |     as OSC jobs at SLURM.                  |
|             |          | -   Uses appropriate SLURM directives --   |
|             |          |     either in the scripts or in a          |
|             |          |     Snakemake profile YAML file.           |
|             |          | -   Has SLURM log files that can be        |
|             |          |     examined by the instructor (please     |
|             |          |     commit these).                         |
+-------------+----------+--------------------------------------------+
| Version     | 2        | -   Has Git commit messages that are       |
| control     |          |     informative.                           |
|             |          | -   Has reasonably appropriate commits,    |
|             |          |     e.g. individual Git commits don't      |
|             |          |     consist of multiple completely         |
|             |          |     unrelated edits.                       |
|             |          | -   Has a single `.gitignore` file that    |
|             |          |     ignores files like large raw data      |
|             |          |     files, and in most cases, results      |
|             |          |     files.                                 |
|             |          | -   *Bonus:* has a Git *tag* for the       |
|             |          |     submitted version.                     |

### Questions and advice

Don't hesitate to contact Jelmer (or, where fitting, Zach) for questions
about topics like:

-   Specific expectations for the final project that are unclear to you.
-   Whether you are on the right track in making some adjustments that I
    asked for after your progress report.
-   Advice on how to code or organize aspects of your project.

We're happy to answer questions by e-mail or in a Zoom meeting!

### Late submissions

Late submission may be accommodated depending on circumstances, but you
will need to contact Jelmer *before 3 pm on April 30th* and we can take
it from there.

For late submissions with no advance notice, 4 points will be subtracted
for each day the submission is late. (Things like forgetting to open an
Issue won't lead to subtracted points.)

### Good luck!!
