## Main exercises

### Exercise 1: Course notes in Markdown

Create a Markdown document with course notes.
I recommend writing this document in *VS Code*.

Cover this week's material in some detail.
If you made notes last week in another format, include those too.
(And try to keep using this document throughout the course!)

Some pointers:

- Use several header levels and use them consistently: e.g. a level 1 header
  (`#`) for the document's title, level 2 headers (`##`) for each week,
  and so on.

- Though it should foremost be a *functional* document for notes,
  try to incorporate any appropriate formatting option:
  e.g. **bold text**, *italic text*, `inline code`, code blocks,
  ordered/unordered lists, hyperlinks, and perhaps a figure.

- You may even want to try your hand at a *table* in Markdown
  (e.g. for an overview of certain commands), though admittedly,
  the syntax for a table is not particularly graceful or easy to use.
  
- Make sure you know how to start a new paragraph and how to force a newline.

### Exercise 2

*While doing this exercise, save the commands you use in a text document --
either write in a text document in VS Code and send the commands to the
terminal, or copy them into a text document later.*

1. **Getting set up**  
   Create a directory for this exercise,
   and change your working dir to go there.
   You can do this either in your `$HOME` dir (e.g. `~/pracs-sp21/w02/ex2/`)
   or your dir in the project dir (`/fs/ess/PAS1855/users/$USER/w02/ex2/`).


2. **Create a disorganized mock project**  
   Using the `touch` command and brace expansions,
   create a mock project by creating 100s of empty files,
   either in a *single directory* or a *disorganized* dir structure.
   
   If you want, you can create file types according to what you typically have
   in your project &mdash; otherwise, create files with:
     - Raw data (e.g. `.fastq.gz`)
     - Reference data (e.g. `.fasta`),
     - Metadata (e.g. `.txt` or `.csv`)
     - Processed data and results (e.g. `.bam`, `.out`)
     - Scripts (e.g. `.sh`, `.py` or `.R`)
     - Figures (e.g. `.png` or `.eps`)
     - Notes (`.txt` and/or `.md`)
     - Perhaps some other file type you usually have in your projects.

3. **Organize the mock project**  
   Organize the mock project according to some of the principles we discussed
   this week.
   
   Even while adhering to these principles, there is plenty of
   wiggle room and no single perfect dir structure: what is optimal
   will depend on what works for you and on the project size and structure.
   Therefore, think about what makes sense to you, and what makes sense
   given the files you find yourself with.
   
   Try to use as few commands as possible to move the files -- use wildcards!

4. **Change file permissions**  
   Change permissions to what you think is reasonable; but in any case,
   make sure no-one has write permissions for the raw data files.

5. **Create mock alignment files**  
   Create a directory `alignment` inside an appropriate dir in your project
   (e.g. `analysis`, `results`, or a dir for *processed* data),
   and create files for all combinations of 30 samples (`01`-`30`),
   5 treatments (`A`-`E`), and 2 dates (`08-14-2020` and `09-16-2020`):
   `sample01_A_08-14-2020.sam` - `sample50_H_09-16-2020.sam`.
   These 300 files can be created with a single `touch` command.

6. **Rename files in a batch**  
   Woops! We stored the alignment files that we created in the previous step
   as SAM files (`.sam`), but this was a mistake --
   the files are actually the binary counterparts of SAM files:
   BAM files (`.bam`).
   
   Move into the dir with your misnamed BAM files,
   and use a `for` loop to rename them:
   change the extension from `.sam` to `.bam`.

   <p>
   This can be most easily done with the `basename` command.
   </p>
   </details>
   
7. **Copy files with wildcards**  
   Still in the dir with your SAM files, create a new dir `subset`.
   Then, using a single `cp` command,
   copy files that satisfy the following conditions into the `subset` dir:
      - The sample number should be 01-19;
      - The treatment should be A, B, or C.
   Create a `README.md` in the dir that explains what you did.
   
   <details>
   <summary>Hints</summary>
   <p>
   You can use two consecutive character sets.
   </p>
   </details>
   
8. **Bonus: a trickier wildcard selection**  
   Still in the dir with your SAM files, create a new dir `subset2`.
   Then, copy all files *except the one for "`sample28`"* into this dir.
   Do so using a single `cp` command, though you'll need two separate wildcard
   expansion or brace expansion arguments
   (as in `cp wildcard-selection1 wildcard-selection2 destination/`).
   
9. **Bonus: a trickier renaming loop**  
   You now realize that your date format is suboptimal (`MM-DD-YYYY` to give
   `08-14-2020` and `09-16-2020`) and that you should use the `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
   Use a `for` loop to rename the files.
   
   <details>
   <summary>Hints</summary>
   <p>
   Test your commands by echo-ing and processing a single file name as
   an example.
   </p>
   </details>

10. **Create a README**  
   Include a `README.md` that described what you did; again, try to get familiar
   with Markdown syntax by using formatting liberally.

## Bonus exercises

### Exercise 3

If you feel like it would be good to reorganize one of your own
projects, you can do so using what you've learned this week.
But make sure you create a backup copy of the entire project first!


### Buffalo Chapter 3 code-along

Move back to `/fs/ess/PAS1855/users/$USER` and download the repository
accompanying the Buffalo book using
`git clone https://github.com/vsbuffalo/bds-files.git`.
Then, move into the new dir `bds-files`, and code along with Buffalo Chapter 3.

### Exercise 2

<details>
<summary>1. Getting set up</summary>
<p>
```sh
mkdir ~/pracs-sp21/w02/ex2/ # or similar, whatever dir you chose
cd !$                       # !$ is a shortcut to recall the last argument from the last commands
```
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Create a disorganized mock project</summary>
<p>
An example:
```sh
touch sample{001..150}_{F,R}.fastq.gz
touch ref.fasta ref.fai
touch sample_info.csv sequence_barcodes.txt
touch sample{001..150}.{bam,.bam.bai,_fastqc.zip,_fastqc.html}.bam.bai gene-counts.tsv DE-results.txt GO-out.txt
touch fastqc.sh multiqc.sh align.sh sort_bam.sh count1.py count2.py DE.R GO.R KEGG.R
touch Fig{1..5}.png all_qc_plots.eps weird-sample.png
touch dontforget.txt README.md README_DE.md tmp5.txt
touch slurm-84789570.out slurm-84789571.out slurm-84789572.out
```
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Organize the mock project</summary>
<p>
An example:

Create directories:
```sh
mkdir -p data/{raw,meta,ref}
mkdir results/{alignment,counts,DE,enrichment,logfiles,qc/figures}
mkdir -p scripts
mkdir -p figures/{ms,sandbox}
mkdir -p doc/misc
```

Move files:
```sh
mv *fastq.gz data/raw/
mv ref.fa* data/ref/
mv sample_info.csv sequence_barcodes.txt data/meta/
mv *.bam *.bam.bai results/alignment/
mv *fastqc* results/qc/
mv gene_counts.tsv results/counts/
mv DE-results.txt results/DE/
mv GO-out.txt results/enrichment/
mv *.sh *.R *.py scripts/
mv README_DE.md results/DE/
mv Fig[0-9]* figures/ms
mv weird-sample.png figures/sandbox
mv all_qc_plots.eps results/qc/figures/
mv dontforget.txt tmp5.txt doc/misc/
mv slurm* results/logfiles/
```
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Change file permissions</summary>
<p>
To ensure that no-one has write permission for the raw data,
you could, for example, use:
```sh
chmod a=r data/raw/*

chmod a-w data/raw/*
```
</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>5. Create mock alignment files</summary>
<p>
```sh
$ mkdir -p results/alignment
$ # rm results/alignment/* # In the example above, we already had such a dir with files

# Create the files:
$ touch sample{01..30}_{A..E}_{08-14-2020,09-16-2020}.sam

# Check if we have 400 files:
$ ls | wc -l
# 400
```
</p>
</details>


<details>
<summary>6. Rename files in a batch</summary>
<p>
```sh
# Move into the directory so we don't have to deal with dirname:
cd results/alignment

# Use *globbing* to match the files to loop over (rather than `ls`):
for oldname in *.sam
do
   # Remove the `sam` suffix using `basename $oldname sam`,
   # use command substitution (`$()` syntax) to catch the output of the
   # `basename` command, and paste `bam` at the end:
   newname=$(basename $oldname sam)bam
   
   # Report what we have:
   # (Using `-e` with echo we can print an extra newline with '\n`,
   # to separate files by an empty line)
   echo "Old name: ${oldname}"
   echo -e "New name: ${newname} \n"
   
   # Execute the move:
   mv ${oldname} ${newname}
done
```

A couple of take-aways:

- Note that we don't need a special construction to paste strings together.
  we simply type `bam` after what will be the extension-less file name
  from the `basename` command.
- We print the old and new names to screen; this is not necessary, of course,
  but good practice.
  Moreover, this way we can test whether our loop works before adding the `mv`
  command.
- We use informative variable names (`oldname` and `newname`),
  not cryptic ones like `i` and `o`.

<summary>7. Copy files with wildcards</summary>
<p>

- Create the new dir:
```sh
mkdir subset
```

- Copy the files using three consecutive wildcard selections:
```sh
cp sample[0-1][0-9]_[A-C]* subset/
```

- Report what we did, including a command substitution to insert the current date:
```sh
echo "On $(date), created a dir "subset" and copied only files for samples 1-29 \
and treatments A-D into this dir" > subset/README.md
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>8. Bonus: a trickier wildcard selection</summary>
<p>

- Create the new dir:
```sh
mkdir subset2
```

- The most straightforward way in this case is using two brace expansion 
  selections, one for sample numbers smaller than 28, and one for sample
  numbers larger than 28:
```sh
cp sample{01..27}* sample{29..30}* subset2/
```

- However, we may not always be able to use ranges, and being a little creative
  with wildcard expansion also works &mdash; first we select all samples not
  starting with a 2, and then among samples that do start with a 2,
  we exclude 28:
```sh
cp sample?[^2]* sample2[^8]* subset2/
```

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>9. Bonus: a trickier renaming loop</summary>
<p>
```sh
for oldname in sample01*.bam
do
   # Use `cut` to extract month, day, year, and a "prefix" that contains
   # the sample number and the treatment, and save these using command substitution:
   month=$(echo ${oldname} | cut -d "_" -f 3 | cut -d "-" -f 1)
   day=$(echo ${oldname} | cut -d "_" -f 3 | cut -d "-" -f 2)
   year=$(basename ${oldname} .bam | cut -d "_" -f 3 | cut -d "-" -f 3)
   prefix=$(echo ${oldname} | cut -d "_" -f 1-2)
   
   # Paste together the new name:
   newname=${prefix}_${year}-${month}-${day}.bam
   
   # Report what we have:
   echo "Old name: ${oldname}"
   echo -e "New name: ${newname} \n"
   
   # Execute the move:
   mv ${oldname} ${newname}
done
```

This can be done more succinctly using *regular expression* and the `sed`
command, both of which we'll learn about later in the course.
