## Introduction

You can connect to OSC with `ssh` if you have a bash shell on your machine,
either natively with a Mac or Linux machine, or via Git Bash or WSL on Windows.

The regular way to do this is typing `ssh <username>@pitzer.osc.edu` and then
providing your password, which can get tedious. There are two setup steps
you can take to make this quicker:

1. Avoid being prompted for your password.

2. Set up a shortcut for your ssh connection name. 

## 1. Avoid being prompted for password

These steps are similar to what you did for your `SSH` Github authentication.

1. *On your own computer*, generate a public-private SSH key-pair:

  ```bash
  $ ssh-keygen -t rsa
  ```
  
  When you're prompted for a passphrase, you can just press enter if you're
  okay with having no passphrase.

If you do want a passphrase, you have to take an extra step to not be prompted,
*after* step 3 below:
  
```sh
$ ssh-add
# Now, you don't enter a passphrase!
```
  
:::

2. *From your own computer*, transfer the public key to the remote computer:

  ```bash
  # Replace <user> by your username, e.g. jelmer@owens.osc.edu
  $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh <user>@owens.osc.edu 'mkdir -p .ssh && cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'
  ```

3. *Log in to the remote computer (OSC) and once there*,
   set appropriate permissions:

  ```bash
  $ chmod 700 .ssh; chmod 640 .ssh/authorized_keys
  ```

## 2. Use a shortcut for your SSH connection

These two steps should both be done on your local machine.

1. Create a file called `~/.ssh/config`:

  ```bash
  $ touch ~/.ssh/config
  ```

2. Open the file in a text editor and add your alias(es) in the following format:

  ```bash
  Host <arbitrary-alias-name>    
       HostName <remote-name>
       User <user-name>
  ```

  For instance, this is what I have for Pitzer and Owens:
  
  ```bash
  Host op
      HostName pitzer.osc.edu
      User jelmer
  
  Host oo
      HostName owens.osc.edu
      User jelmer
  ```

Now, you just need to use your, preferably very short, alias to log in:

```sh
$ ssh op
```

Moreover, this will also work with `scp` and `rsync`:

```sh
$ rsync ~/scripts op:/fs/ess/PAS1855/scripts
```
