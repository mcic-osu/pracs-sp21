## Content overview for this week

This week, we'll start with an introduction to OSC and supercomputers.
Then, we'll see how we can submit shell scripts to OSC's queue for compute jobs
with the widely-used SLURM resource manager.

**Some of the things you will learn this week:**

- Understand when and why we need to run our analyses on supercomputers.
- Learn the key terminology around supercomputers.
- Learn about different ways to access OSC.
- Learn about different ways to transfer data to and from OSC.
- Learn about different ways to start compute jobs: via OnDemand, with interactive jobs, and with scripts.
- Learn some strategies around requesting appropriate resources for your compute jobs.
- Learn the SLURM/`sbatch` syntax to request specific resources for your compute jobs.
- Learn how to monitor SLURM jobs.

## Readings

This week's required reading is a little unusual, as it is not a book chapter.
Instead, you will read part of the OSC documentation.
There are some pointers below,
but you are welcome to use your own judgment in how much you want to read.
You are also encouraged to simply look around on OSC's website a bit to get an idea of what's there,
and bookmark pages that you think will be useful for you later on.

### Required readings

Part of the OSC documentation:

- Your first starting point should be the
  [New User Resource Guide](https://www.osc.edu/resources/getting_started/new_user_resource_guide)
  At least read or carefully look at the first few pages including "HPC Basics" and "Getting Connected".

- Your second starting point should be the
  [Batch Processing at OSC pages](https://www.osc.edu/supercomputing/batch-processing-at-osc)
  Again, at least read or carefully look at the first few pages including
  "Batch System Concepts", "Batch Execution Environment", and "Job Scripts"
  (in that last section, you can stop when you reach "Considerations for parallel jobs",
  unless this is something that interests you).

### Optional readings

- [Buffalo](https://library.ohio-state.edu/record=b8538907~S7)
  Chapter 4: "Working with Remote Machines"
