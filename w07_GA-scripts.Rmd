Exercise X

Now, we'll use the same script template to run FastQC, a ubiquitous piece of software that performs quality control (QC) checks on a FASTQ file.The syntax for FastQC is as follows:

fastqc --outdir=<output-dir> <fastq-file>

For instance:

fastqc --outdir=results/QC/ data/seqs/sampleA.fastq

Modify the line in the script that calls fastq_stat to one that calls FastQC.
