Edit March 4: I have moved part of the exercises on lists and all those on
dictionaries and sets to the [page with exercises for week 9](w09_exercises.html).
Though you are welcome to work ahead to those already,
the exercise that remain here cover the material that we ended up discussing
in class this week. 
</i></span>

## Setup

-   Open a new file and save it as `week08_exercises.py` or something along
    those lines.

-   Type your commands in the script and send them to the prompt in the Python
    interactive window by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>.

    <details>

    <summary>Problems with the keyboard shortcut?</summary>\
    If this doesn't work, check your keyboard shortcut by right-clicking in the
    script and looking for "Run Selection/Line In Python Interactive Window".\
    \
    Also, you can open the Command Palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>)
    and look for that shortcut there, and change it if you want.

    </details>

-   Because these exercises have many small steps, I put the solutions right below the question, so you don't have to scroll back-and-forth all the time. *However*, make sure you actually try to do the exercises!

<br>

## Exercise 1: Variable types and strings

1.  Print the type of the value `4.88`.\

    <details>

    <summary>Solution</summary>

    We can use the function `type()`:

    ```{python}
    type(4.88)
    ```
    
    The result would be the same if we first assigned it as a variable:
    ```{python}
    num = 4.88
    type(num)
    ```

    </details>

2.  Assign the variable `n_samples = 658`, and then extract the third character from `n_samples`.

    <details>

    <summary>Hints</summary>\
    You can't index a number like `n_samples[index]`, so you'll first have to convert `n_samples` to a string. Also, recall that Python starts counting from 0!

    </details>

    <details>

    <summary>Solution</summary>

    ```{python}
    n_samples = 658
    str(n_samples)[2]
    ```

    </details>

3.  Assign the string 'CTTATGGAAT' to a variable called `adapter`. Print the number of characters in `adapter`.\

    <details>

    <summary>Solution</summary>

    ```{python}
    adapter = 'CTTATGGAAT'
    len(adapter)
    ```

    </details>

4.  Replace all `A`s by `N`s in `adapter` and assign the resulting string to a new variable. Print the new variable.\
    
    <details>

    <summary>Hints</summary>\
    Use the string method `replace()`, and recall that methods are called using
    the `<object_name>.<method_name>()` syntax.

    </details>

    <details>

    <summary>Solution</summary>

    ```{python}
    bad_seq = adapter.replace('A', 'N')
    bad_seq
    ```

    </details>

5.  Find out what the third argument to the `replace()` method does by using the built-in help.\

    <details>

    <summary>Hints</summary>\
    If you are typing your commands in a script rather than straight in the console, you will get some more information already when typing the opening parenthesis of the method (briefly pause if necessary).\
    \
    To get more help, you can use a notation with a `?`, or `help(object.method)`.

    </details>

    <details>

    <summary>Solution</summary>

    ```{python}
    help(adapter.replace)
    # Or: "adapter.replace?"
    # Or: "?adapter.replace"
    ```

    As it turns out, the third argument, `count`, determines how many instances of the substring will be replaced.\

    </details>

6.  Using what you found out in the previous steps, replace just the first two `A`s in `adapter` by `N`s.\

    <details>

    <summary>Solution</summary>\
    We specify `2` as the third argument, which is the number of instances of the substring that will be replaced:

    ```{python}
    adapter.replace('A', 'N', 2)
    ```

    </details>

7.  Convert the following strings and numbers to a Boolean value to see what the resulting Boolean is (True or False): `"False"` (with quotes), `0`, `1`, `-1`, `""`, `None`, and see if you can make sense of these results.\

    <details>

    <summary>Solution</summary>

    ```{python}
    bool("False")
    ```

    ```{python}
    bool(1)
    ```

    ```{python}
    bool(0)
    ```

    ```{python}
    bool(-1)
    ```

    As it turns out, among numbers and strings, *only* 0 is interpreted as `False`,
    whereas *anything else* is interpreted as `True`.

    ```{python}
    bool("")
    ```

    ```{python}
    bool()
    ```

    ```{python}
    bool(None)
    ```
    
    But an empty string, nothing at all between parenthesis, and `None` (Python's keyword to define a null     value or the lack of a value), are also interpreted as `False`.
    
    Note that as soon as you quote `"None"`, it is a string again and will be interpreted as `True`:

    ```{python}
    bool("None")
    ```

    </details>

8.  Have a look at the names of the methods that appear when you type `adapter.` (note the `.`). Can you find a method that will print the *last* occurrence of a `T` in `adapter`?\

    <details>

    <summary>Hints</summary>\
    The method `rfind` will search from the right-hand side (hence `r`), and will therefore print the last occurrence of the specified substring.

    </details>

    <details>

    <summary>Solution</summary>

    ```{python}
    adapter.rfind("T")
    ```

    </details>

9. Split the sequence by `GAGTCCCTNNNAGCAACGTTNNTTCGTCATTAN` by `N`s.\

    <details>
    
    <summary>Hints</summary>\
    Use the `split()` method for strings.

    </details>

    <details>

    <summary>Solution</summary>

    ```{python}
    seq = "GAGTCCCTNNNAGCAACGTTNNTTCGTCATTAN"
    split_seq = seq.split('N')
    split_seq
    ```

    </details>

## Exercise 2: Lists

1.  Assign a list `plant_diseases` that contains the items `fruit_rot`, `leaf_blight`, `leaf_spots`, `stem_blight`, `canker`, `wilt`, `root_knot` and `root_rot`.\

    <details>

    <summary>Solution</summary>

    ```{python}
    diseases = ['fruit_rot', 'leaf_blight', 'leaf_spots', 'stem_blight',
                'canker', 'wilt', 'root_knot', 'root_rot']
    ```

    </details>

2.  Extract `stem_blight` from `diseases` by its index (position).\

    <details>

    <summary>Solution</summary>\
    `stem_blight` is the fourth item and because Python starts counting at 0, this is index number 3.

    ```{python}
    diseases[3]
    ```

    </details>

3.  Extract the first 5 items from `diseases`.\

    <details>

    <summary>Hints</summary>\
    Recall that when using ranges, Python does *not* include the item corresponding to the last index.

    </details>

    <details>

    <summary>Solution</summary>\
    While index 5 is the *sixth* item, it is not included, so we specify `0:5` or `:5` to extract elements up to and including the fifth one:

    ```{python}
    diseases[0:5]
    ```

    Or:

    ```{python}
    diseases[:5]
    ```

    </details>

4.  Extract the last item from `diseases`.\

    <details>

    <summary>Hints</summary>\
    Recall that you can use negative numbers to start counting from the end.
    Also, while `0` is the first index, "-0" (or something along those lines)
    is *not* the last index.

    </details>

    <details>

    <summary>Solution</summary>

    ```{python}
    diseases[-1]
    ```

    </details>

5.  Extract the last 3 items from `diseases`.\

    <details>

    <summary>Solution</summary>\
    Note that you'll *have to* omit a number after the colon in this case, because `[-3:-1]` would not include the last number, and `[-3:0]` does not work either.

    ```{python}
    diseases[-3:]
    ```

    </details>
