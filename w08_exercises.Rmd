## Setup

- Open a new file and save it as `week08_exercises.py`
  or something along those lines.

- Type your commands in the script and send them to the prompt in the Python
  interactive window by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>.

<details>
<summary>Problems with the keyboard shortcut?</summary>
<p>

If this doesn't work, check your keyboard shortcut by right-clicking in the script and looking for "Run Selection/Line In Python Interactive Window".

Also, you can open the Command Palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>)
and look for that shortcut there, and change it if you want.

</p>
</details>

- Because these first two exercises have many small steps,
  I put the solutions right below the question, so you don't have to scroll
  back-and-forth all the time.
  *However*, make sure you actually try to do the exercises before you look at
  the solutions!

<br>

## Exercise 1: Variable types and strings

1.  Print the type of the value `4.88`.\

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

We can use the function `type()`:

```{python}
type(4.88)
```
    
The result would be the same if we first assigned it as a variable:
```{python}
num = 4.88
type(num)
```

</details>

2. Assign the variable `n_samples = 658`,
   and then extract the third character from `n_samples`.

<details><summary>Hints</summary>
<p>

You can't index a number like `n_samples[index]`,
so you'll first have to convert `n_samples` to a string.
Also, recall that Python starts counting from 0!

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
n_samples = 658
str(n_samples)[2]
```

</p>
</details>

3. Assign the string 'CTTATGGAAT' to a variable called `adapter`.
   Print the number of characters in `adapter`.\

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
adapter = 'CTTATGGAAT'
len(adapter)
```

</p>
</details>

4. Replace all `A`s by `N`s in `adapter` and assign the resulting string
   to a new variable. Print the new variable.

<details><summary>Hints</summary>
<p>

Use the string method `replace()`, and recall that methods are called using
the `<object_name>.<method_name>()` syntax.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
bad_seq = adapter.replace('A', 'N')
bad_seq
```

</details>

5. Find out what the third argument to the `replace()` method does by using
   the built-in help.

<details><summary>Hints</summary>
<p>

If you are typing your commands in a script rather than straight in the console,
you will get some more information already when typing the opening parenthesis of the method (briefly pause if necessary).

To get more help, you can use a notation with a `?`, or `help(object.method)`.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
help(adapter.replace)
# Or: "adapter.replace?"
# Or: "?adapter.replace"
```

As it turns out, the third argument, `count`,
determines how many instances of the substring will be replaced.

</p>
</details>

6. Using what you found out in the previous steps,
   replace just the first two `A`s in `adapter` by `N`s.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

We specify `2` as the third argument,
which is the number of instances of the substring that will be replaced:

```{python}
adapter.replace('A', 'N', 2)
```

</p>
</details>

7. Convert the following strings and numbers to a Boolean value
   to see what the resulting Boolean is (True or False):
   `"False"` (with quotes), `0`, `1`, `-1`, `""`, `None`,
   and see if you can make sense of these results.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
bool("False")
```

```{python}
bool(1)
```

```{python}
bool(0)
```

```{python}
bool(-1)
```

As it turns out, among numbers and strings, *only* 0 is interpreted as `False`,
whereas *anything else* is interpreted as `True`.

```{python}
bool("")
```

```{python}
bool()
```

```{python}
bool(None)
```
    
But an empty string, nothing at all between parenthesis,
and `None` (Python's keyword to define a null value or the lack of a value),
are also interpreted as `False`.
    
Note that as soon as you quote `"None"`,
it is a string again and will be interpreted as `True`:

```{python}
bool("None")
```

</p>
</details>

8. Have a look at the names of the methods that appear when you type `adapter.`
   (note the `.`).
   Can you find a method that will print the *last* occurrence of a `T` in
   `adapter`?

<details><summary>Hints</summary>
<p>

The method `rfind` will search from the right-hand side (hence `r`),
and will therefore print the last occurrence of the specified substring.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
adapter.rfind("T")
```

</p>
</details>

9. Split the sequence by `GAGTCCCTNNNAGCAACGTTNNTTCGTCATTAN` by `N`s.

<details><summary>Hints</summary>
<p>

Use the `split()` method for strings.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
seq = "GAGTCCCTNNNAGCAACGTTNNTTCGTCATTAN"
split_seq = seq.split('N')
split_seq
```

</p>
</details>

<br>

## Exercise 2: Lists

1. Assign a list `plant_diseases` that contains the items `fruit_rot`,
   `leaf_blight`, `leaf_spots`, `stem_blight`, `canker`, `wilt`, `root_knot` and
   `root_rot`.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
diseases = ['fruit_rot', 'leaf_blight', 'leaf_spots', 'stem_blight',
            'canker', 'wilt', 'root_knot', 'root_rot']
```

</p>
</details>

2. Extract `stem_blight` from `diseases` by its index (position).

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

`stem_blight` is the fourth item and because Python starts counting at 0,
this is index number 3.

```{python}
diseases[3]
```

</p>
</details>

3. Extract the first 5 items from `diseases`.


<details><summary>Hints</summary>
<p>

Recall that when using ranges,
Python does *not* include the item corresponding to the last index.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

While index 5 is the *sixth* item, it is not included,
so we specify `0:5` or `:5` to extract elements up to and including the fifth one:

```{python}
diseases[0:5]
```

Or:

```{python}
diseases[:5]
```

</p>
</details>

4. Extract the last item from `diseases`.

<details><summary>Hints</summary>
<p>

Recall that you can use negative numbers to start counting from the end.
Also, while `0` is the first index, "-0" (or something along those lines)
is *not* the last index.

</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
diseases[-1]
```

</p>
</details>

5.  Extract the last 3 items from `diseases`.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

Note that you'll *have to* omit a number after the colon in this case,
because `[-3:-1]` would not include the last number, and `[-3:0]` does not
work either.

```{python}
diseases[-3:]
```

</p>
</details>


## Exercise 3: Dictionaries

1.  Create and print a dictionary called `yield_current` with the following items:

``` {.python}
{"plotA_1": 12, "plotA_2": 18, "plotA_3": 2,
 "plotB_1": 33, "plotB_2": 28, "plotB_3": 57}
```

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
yield_current = {"plotA_1": 12, "plotA_2": 18, "plotA_3": 2,
                 "plotB_1": 33, "plotB_2": 28, "plotB_3": 57}
                 
yield_current                 
```

</p>
</details>

2.  Print just the value for key `plotA_3`.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

We can get the value for a specific key using the `<dict>[<key>]` notation:

```{python}
yield_current["plotA_3"]
```

</p>
</details>

3.  Update the value for key `plotB_2` to be `31` and check whether this worked.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

We can simply assign a new value using `=`:

```{python}
yield_current["plotB_2"] = 31
yield_current["plotB_2"]
```

</p>
</details>

4.  Count the number of items (i.e. entries, key-value *pairs*) in your dictionary.\

<details><summary>Hints</summary>
<p>

Use the `len()` function.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
len(yield_current)
```

</p>
</details>

5. ***Bonus:*** Create a dictionary `obs_20210305` with keys `plotA_3` and
   `plotC_1`, and values `18` and `3`, respectively.
    
   Then, update the `yield_current` dictionary with the `obs_20210305` dictionary,
   and check whether this worked.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
obs_20210305 = {"plotA_3": 18, "plotC_1": 3}
```

We use the `update()` method as follows:

```{python}
yield_current.update(obs_20210305)

yield_current
```

Now, our dictionary has an updated value for key "plotA\_3",
and an entirely new item with key "plotC\_1".

</p>
</details>

7.  ***Bonus:*** Get and count the number of *unique values* in your dictionary.

<details><summary>Hints</summary>
<p>

Extract the values with the `values()` method.
Next, turn these values into a *set* to get the unique values.
Finally, count the unique values with the `len()` function.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
len(set(yield_current.values()))
```

</p>
</details>

## Exercise 4: Sets

1. Assign a set named `dna` with 4 items: each of the 4 bases (single-letter
   abbreviations) in DNA.

<details><summary>Hints</summary>
<p>

- Recall the use of curly braces to assign a set.
    
- The order of the bases doesn't matter, because sets are unordered.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
dna = {'A', 'G', 'C', 'T'}
```

</p>
</details>

2. Assign a set named `rna` with 4 items: each of the 4 bases
   (single-letter abbreviations) in RNA.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
rna = {'A', 'G', 'C', 'U'}
```

</p>
</details>

3. Find the 3 bases that are shared between DNA and in RNA
   (try both with an *operator* and a *method*, if you want).

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
dna & rna
```

Or:

```{python}
dna.intersection(rna)
```

</p>
</details>

4. Find all 5 bases that are collectively found among DNA and RNA.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
dna | rna
```

Or:

```{python}
dna.union(rna)
```

</p>
</details>

5. Find the base that only occurs in DNA.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
dna - rna
```

Or:

```{python}
dna.difference(rna)
```

</p>
</details>

6. Assign a set named `purines` with the two purine bases and a set named
   `pyrimidines` with the three pyrimidine bases.

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
purines = {'A', 'G'}
pyrimidines = {'C', 'T', 'U'}
```

</p>
</details>

7. Find the pyrimidine that occurs both in RNA and DNA.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

You can combine more than two sets either by chaining methods or adding another operator.

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
pyrimidines & dna & rna
```

Or:

```{python}
pyrimidines.intersection(dna).intersection(rna)
```

</p>
</details>

8. ***Bonus:*** Find the pyrimidine that occurs in RNA but not DNA.

<details><summary>Solution</summary>
<p>

```{python}
(rna - dna) & pyrimidines
```

Or:

```{python}
rna - dna & pyrimidines
```

Or:

```{python}
rna.difference(dna).intersection(pyrimidines)
```

</p>
</details>
