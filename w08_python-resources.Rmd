Here is a list of recommended Python resources. Most are geared towards beginners
(in Python and programming alike).
Also, the bioinformatics-specific books are all quite practical,
describing "applied bioinformatics" -- i.e. more how to analyze your data than
how to write your own algorithms.

## Available online via the OSU library

- Book: [Python for the life sciences: a gentle introduction to python for life scientists](https://library.ohio-state.edu/record=b8792177~S7)
  (Alexandar Lancestar, 2019).
  This book is very explicitly geared towards biologists with no or little
  programming experience, and takes a very practical and project-oriented
  approach. From what I've seen of the book this one is highly recommended! 

- Book: [Python for Bioinformatics](https://library.ohio-state.edu/record=b8257944~S7)
  (Sebastian Bassi, 2018).
  This book also starts with an introduction to Python and then has chapters that
  each describe practical problems/projects,
  like "Calculating melting temperature from a set of primers".
  
- Book: [Python programming for biology, bioinformatics, and beyond](https://library.ohio-state.edu/record=b8928994~S7) (Tim Stevens, 2015).
  This book starts with an introduction to Python and then has chapters on topics
  like "Pairwise sequence alignments", "Sequence variation and evolution",
  and "High-throughput sequences".

- Book: [Reproducible Bioinformatics with Python](https://library.ohio-state.edu/record=b9208582~S7) (Ken Youens-Clark, 2021).
  This is a slightly more advanced book that does not start with an introduction
  to Python, but you should be able to follow this week with what you'll learn
  in this course.
