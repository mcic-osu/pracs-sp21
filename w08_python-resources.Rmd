## General resources for learning Python

Here is a list of recommended resources for learning Python.
Most are geared towards beginners (in Python and programming alike).
Also, the bioinformatics-specific books are all quite practical,
describing "applied bioinformatics" -- i.e. more how to analyze your data than
how to write your own algorithms.

### Available online via the OSU library

- Book: [Python for the life sciences: a gentle introduction to python for life scientists](https://library.ohio-state.edu/record=b8792177~S7)
  (Alexandar Lancestar, 2019).
  This book is very explicitly geared towards biologists with no or little
  programming experience, and takes a very practical and project-oriented
  approach. From what I've seen of the book, I can highly recommended it! 

- Book: [Python for Bioinformatics](https://library.ohio-state.edu/record=b8257944~S7)
  (Sebastian Bassi, 2018).
  This book also starts with an introduction to Python and then has chapters that
  each describe practical problems/projects for Python,
  like "Calculating melting temperature from a set of primers".
  
- Book: [Python programming for biology, bioinformatics, and beyond](https://library.ohio-state.edu/record=b8928994~S7) (Tim Stevens, 2015).
  This book starts with an introduction to Python and then has chapters on topics
  like "Pairwise sequence alignments", "Sequence variation and evolution",
  and "High-throughput sequences".

- Book: [Reproducible Bioinformatics with Python](https://library.ohio-state.edu/record=b9208582~S7) (Ken Youens-Clark, 2021).
  This is a slightly more advanced book that does not start with an introduction
  to Python, but you should be able to follow the book with what you'll learn
  over the next couple of weeks in the course.

### Free online resources

#### Videos

- [A YouTube playlist of Microsoft videos introducing Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLlrxD0HtieHhS8VzuMCfQD4uJ9yne1mE6&v=jFCNu1-Xdsw)

#### Courses

- [Python for everybody](https://www.py4e.com/) -- includes course materials
  and lectures, and is also available at Coursera and edX.

- [Programming for Biology](http://programmingforbiology.org/index.html) --
  This is the Cold Spring Harbor course that your TA Zach took,
  and the materials are available online.
  
### Not free
  
- Book: [Bioinformatics with Python Cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Bioinformatics-Python-Cookbook-bioinformatics-computational/dp/1789344697) (Tiago Antao, 2018).
