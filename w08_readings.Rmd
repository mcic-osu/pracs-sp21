### Content overview for this week

This is the first of 5 consecutive weeks focused entirely on Python,
which will hopefully get you a solid introduction to this very useful language.
We will start by working our way through the first part of CSB Chapter 3 (3.1-3.4)
to get acquainted with Python basics.

**Some of the things you will learn this week:**

- Understand why we will be learning Python in this course.

- Learn how to use Python in VS Code.

- Learn the basics of Python syntax.

- Learn how to work with different variable types:
  strings, integers, floats, and Booleans.

- Learn about the four basic data structures in Python:
  lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.

### Readings

Assuming that you are completely new to Python,
I recommend that you at least quickly read CSB 3.1-3.4 before class and that you
also go through it once more *after class*,
preferably interactively with an open Python prompt.
Before we move on,
it will be important to get some Python fundamentals under your fingers.
