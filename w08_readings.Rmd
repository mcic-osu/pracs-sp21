## Content overview for this week

This is the first of 5 consecutive weeks focused entirely on Python,
which will hopefully get you a solid introduction to this very useful language.
We will start by working our way through the first part of CSB Chapter 3 (3.1-3.4)
to get acquainted with Python basics.

**Some of the things you will learn this week:**

- Understand why we will be learning Python in this course.

- Learn how to use Python in VS Code.

- Learn the basics of Python syntax.

- Learn how to work with different variable types:
  strings, integers, floats, and Booleans.

- Learn about the four basic data structures in Python:
  lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.

## Readings

This week, we will work our way through the first part of CSB Chapter 3:
sections 3.1-3.4.
This will provide you with an introduction to Python basics,
including a fairly extensive treatment of its four basic data structures:
lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets.

Assuming that you are completely new to Python,
I recommend that you at least quickly read CSB 3.1-3.4 before class and that you
also go through it once more *after class*,
preferably interactively with an open Python prompt.
Before we move on,
it will be important to get some Python fundamentals under your fingers.

### Required readings

- **[CSB](https://library.ohio-state.edu/record=b8624007~S7)**
  **Chapter 3.1 - 3.4: "Basic Programming"**

  Note: Where the CSB text says to save a file as a Jupyter Notebook
  (with the `.ipynb` extension),
  you can just create a regular Python script (`.py` extension) --
  nothing in the code is specific to Jupyter Notebooks.
  
  If you *want* to play around with Jupyter Notebooks,
  you can actually do this in VS Code:
  simply save a file with the `.ipynb` extension and see what happens.
  Here is some [VS Code documentation on its Jupyter support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support).
  If you would want to try Jupyter Notebooks in their native environment,
  you can do so via OSC OnDemand:
  see [this section](https://mcic-osu.github.io/pracs-sp21/w08_python-resources.html#jupyter-notebooks-jupyterlab) of this site's Python resources page.

### Further Resources

- See the **[Python resources](../../w08_python-resources.html)** page on this
  site for a list of general resources for learning Python!
