## Setup

- Open a new file and save it as `week09_exercises.py`
  or something along those lines.

- Type your commands in the script and send them to the prompt in the Python
  interactive window by pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>.

<details>
<summary>Problems with the keyboard shortcut?</summary>
<p>

If this doesn't work, check your keyboard shortcut by right-clicking in the script and looking for "Run Selection/Line In Python Interactive Window".

Also, you can open the Command Palette (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>)
and look for that shortcut there, and change it if you want.

## Intro to CSB exercises

From the CSB Chapter 3 preface to the exercises:

> Here are some practical tips on how to approach the Python exercises (or any programming task):
>
> -   Think through the problem before starting to write code: Which data structure would be more convenient to use (e.g., sets, dictionaries, lists)?
> -   Break the task down into small steps (e.g., read file input, create and fill data structure, output).
> -   For each step, describe in plain English what you are trying to do--- leave these notes as comments within your program to document your code.
> -   When working with large files, initially use only a small subset of the data; once you have tested your code thoroughly you can run it on the whole data set.
> -   Consider using specific modules (e.g., use the csv module to parse each line into a dictionary or a list).
> -   Skim through appropriate sections above to refresh your memory on data-type-specific methods.
> -   Use the documentation and help forums.

## Exercise CSB-1: Measles time series

In their article, [Dalziel et al. (2016)](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004655)
provide a long time series reporting the numbers of cases of measles before mass vaccination, for many US cities. The data consist of cases in a given US city for a given year, and a given "biweek" of the year (i.e., first two weeks, second two weeks, etc.). The time series is contained in the file `Dalziel2016_data.csv`.

1.  Write a program that extracts the names of all the cities in the database (one entry per city).

<details><summary>Hints</summary>
<p>

- While you could try to parse the file from scratch (you have learnt the
  building blocks to do so), using the `DictReader` from the `csv` module,
  as we did in class, will make this easier.

- The city name is in the column `loc`.

- Because each city is reported multiple times, the main task here is to remove
  duplicates. Using a `set` will be the easiest way to do so, since sets
  cannot contain duplicates.

- You don't need to write to a new file here, just print the `set` after
  you are done processing the file.
  
- Pseudocode:

  ```
  import csv
  cities = an empty set
  open data for reading
  create dictionary reader
  for each row in the file
      add the city to the set
  ```

</p>
</details>
    
2. Write a program that creates a dictionary where the keys are the cities and
   the values are the number of records (rows) for that city in the data.

<details>
<summary>Hints</summary>
<p>

- Initialize an empty dictionary before you start looping over the lines.

- For every line, extract the city name and add 1 to the value for that
  city in your dictionary, since you are counting rows.
  
- You don't need to prepopulate the dictionary with all cities:
  when you provide a default value with the `get()` method,
  a key that is not yet present will be added to the dictionary with said
  default value.
  
  For example, we can build up a dictionary using `get()` like so:
  
  ```{python}
  dd = {} # empty dictionary
  my_list = ['a', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'd', 'b', 'a']
  for element in my_list:
      dd[element] = dd.get(element, 0) + 1
  
  print(dd)
  ```

- Pseudocode:

  ```
  import csv library
  citycount = an empty dictionary
  open file for reading
  set up dictionary reader
    for each line in data
	      my_city = extract the city
	      citycount[my_city] = use get to update value
  ```

</p>  
</details>

3. Write a program that calculates the mean population for each city,
   obtained by averaging the values of `pop`.

<details><summary>Hints</summary>
<p>

- Note that for some reason, the population sizes have decimal values.

- Again, use a dictionary that you keep adding to for each row of the data
  set. This time, though, *each value in the dictionary should be a list
  of two items*: the total population, and the number of occurences.

- In your `get()` call, you can initialize the values to be a list of two
  items as follows (here assuming the dictionary is called `citypop` and the
  city's name has been extracted as `mycity`):
  
  ```py
  citypop[mycity] = citypop.get(mycity, [0, 0])
  ```

- Then, you can refer to each item in the dictionary's values by chaining
  indices, e.g. `citypop[mycity][0]`.

- Pseudocode:
  
```
import csv
citypop = an empty dictionary
open data file reading
set up dictionary reader

for each line in data
  my_city = extract the city
  my_pop = extract population
  if this is the first time you see this city, initialize:
     citypop[my_city] = [0.0, 0]
  citypop[my_city][0] = what it was before + my_pop
  citypop[my_city][1] = what it was before + 1

for each city
  divide the first element by the second to obtain the mean
```

</p>  
</details>
    
4. Write a program that calculates the mean population for each city and year.

<details><summary>Hints</summary>
<p>

- You can do this in (at least) two ways with a dictionary:
  
  - By creating a nested dictionary: each city is a dictionary,
    which itself contains a dictionary for each year.
  
  - By using a `(city, year)` tuple as the keys for the dictionary.
  
Note that the worked-out solution in the link below uses the first strategy.

## Bonus: Exercise CSB-2: Red queen in fruit flies

[Singh et al. (2015)](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6249/747)
show that, when infected with a parasite,
the four genetic lines of *D. melanogaster* respond by increasing the production
of recombinant offspring
(arguably, trying to produce new recombinants able to escape the parasite).
They show that the same outcome is not achieved by artificially wounding the flies.
The data needed to replicate the main claim (figure 2 of the original article) is contained in the file `Singh2015_data.csv`.

Open the file, and compute the mean `RecombinantFraction` for each *Drosophila* genetic line, and `InfectionStatus` (`W` for wounded and `I` for infected).

Print the results in the following form:

``` {.sh}
Line 45 Average Recombination Rate:
W : 0.187
I : 0.191
```

<details><summary>Hints</summary>
<p>

For each Dropsophila genetic line, you need to keep track of all the recombination
rates for W (wounded) and I (infected).

For example, you could build a dictionary of dictionaries in which the first (outer)
dictionary has a key for each line,
and the inner dictionary has a key for each status (`W` or `I`)
and a list of recombination rates as each value.

Then, you would calculate averages for each list at the end.
