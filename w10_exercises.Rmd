Start with the list you created last week:

```{python}
diseases = ['fruit_rot', 'leaf_blight', 'leaf_spots', 'stem_blight',
            'canker', 'wilt', 'root_knot', 'root_rot']
```

1.  If you would run:

    ```{python, eval=FALSE}
    more_diseases = diseases

    more_diseases.append("crown_galls")
    ```

    Would the list `diseases` contain `crown_galls`? Think about what the answer should be, and then check if you were right.\

    <details>

    <summary>Solution</summary>\
    Yes, `diseases` will contain the item `crown_galls` that was added to `more_diseases`, because `more_diseases` in not an independent list but is merely a second pointer to the same list that `diseases` points to.

    ```{python}
    more_diseases = diseases

    more_diseases.append("crown_galls")

    diseases
    ```

    </details>

2.  Copy `diseases` to a new list with a name of your choice -- the new list should *not* be linked to `diseases`. Then, remove all items from the new list. Check if `diseases` still contains its items -- if not, you'll have to try again!\

    <details>

    <summary>Hints</summary>\
    To create a copy, use the `copy()` method or the `[:]` notation.

    <details>

    <summary>Solution</summary>\
    To create a copy, use the `copy()` method:

    ```{python}
    diseases_copy = diseases.copy()
    ```

    Or the `[:]` notation.

    ```{python}
    diseases_copy = diseases[:]
    ```

    Then, to remove all elements in the copy of the list:

    ```{python}
    diseases_copy.clear()

    diseases
    ```

3.  What fundamental difference between lists and strings makes it so that `newstring = oldstring` creates *a new string*, whereas `newlist = oldlist` simply creates a new *pointer to the same list*?\

    <details>

    <summary>Solution</summary>\
    The fact that strings are *immutable*, whereas lists are *mutable*.
