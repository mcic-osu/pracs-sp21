## Content overview for this week

This week, we wil talk about several strategies for writing "good" code:
code that is clear, modular, flexible, and easy to troubleshoot.

**Some of the things you will learn this week:**

- Understand the basics of Python's module and package system,
  and how to import modules into your script or session.

- Understand why you should write your own functions, and learn how to write them in Python.

- Learn what a good structure for a program (script) is.

- Learn some basic Python coding style guidelines for clear code.

- Learn how to call Python scripts from the shell.

- Learn how to interpret and handle errors that arise.

- Better understand the difference between mutable and immutable Python data
  structures and the need to explicitly copy mutable data structures.

And optionally:

- Learn how to debug Python code with a debugger.

- Learn what unit testing and profiling is,
  and how to perform some basic implementations of this in Python.
