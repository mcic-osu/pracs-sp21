### Content overview for this week

This week, we wil talk about several strategies for writing "good" code:
code that is clear, modular, flexible, and easy to troubleshoot.

**Some of the things you will learn this week:**

- The basics of Python's module and package system,
  and how to import modules into your script or session.

- Why you should write your own functions, and learn how to write them in Python.

- How to properly *structure* your code.

- How to run Python scripts from the shell.

- How to interpret and handle errors.

- Better understand the difference between mutable and immutable Python data
  structures and the need to explicitly copy mutable data structures.

And optionally:

- Python coding style guidelines for clear code.

- How to debug Python code with a debugger.

- What unit testing and profiling is,
  and how to perform some basic implementations of this in Python.
