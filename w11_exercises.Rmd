## CSB Intermezzo 6.2

Gächter and Schulz (2016) performed a provocative experiment to study
intrinsic honesty in different countries. Groups of students were asked to per-
form two rolls of a fair die, and to report the result of the first roll. They
were paid an amount of money proportional to the reported number, with
the exception that they were given no money when they reported rolling a 6.

The subjects knew of the monetary reward, and that their rolls were
private—the experimenters could not determine whether they were telling
the truth or not. If everybody were to tell the truth, we would expect that each
claim (from 0 to 5 monetary units) would be equally represented in the data,
with a proportion of 16 = 0.16. Countries where cheaters were more abundant
would have a higher proportion of subjects claiming a reward of 5 units and
a lower proportion of those claiming 0 units.

1. Load the file ( data/Gachter2016_data.csv ) using pandas . Which
country reported the smallest frequency of Claim == 0 (meaning
fewest honest players)? Which the highest?

2. Now calculate the reported frequency of rolling the number 5 (which
would lead to a claim of 5 units) for each country. Which country has
the lowest frequency (most honest players)? Which the highest? Notice
that the data report cumulative frequencies; to obtain the frequency of
rolling a 5, you need to subtract the cumulative frequency of claiming
4 monetary units from 1.0.

## CSB Exercise 1: Lord of the Fruit Flies

Suppose you need information on how to breed Drosophila virilis in your lab-
oratory and you would like to contact an expert. Conduct a PubMed query
on who has published most contributions on D. virilis. This person might be
a good researcher to contact.

1. Identify how many papers in the PubMed database have the words
Drosophila virilis in their title or abstract. Use the usehistory argument
so you can refer to this search in the next step.
2. Retrieve the PubMed entries that were identified in step (1).
3. Count the number of contributions per author.
4. Identify the five authors with the most contributions.

## CSB Exercise 2: Number of Reviewers and Rejection Rate

Fox et al. (2016) studied the effects on the outcome of papers of the genders
of the handling editors and reviewers. For the study, they compiled a database
including all the submissions to the journal Functional Ecology from 2004 to
2014. Their data are reported in data/Fox2016_data.csv . Besides the effects
of gender and bias in journals, the data can be used to investigate whether
manuscripts having more reviewers are more likely to be rejected. Note that
this hypothesis should be tested for reviewed manuscripts, that is, excluding
“desk rejections” without review.
1. Import the data using pandas , and count the number of reviewers (by
summing ReviewerAgreed ) for each manuscript (i.e., unique MsID ). The
column FinalDecision contains 1 for rejection, and 0 for acceptance.
Compile a table measuring the probability of rejection given the number
of reviewers. Does having more reviewers increase the probability of
being rejected?
2. Write a function to repeat the analysis above for each year represented
in the database. For example, you should return


```sh
Year: 2009
Submissions: 626
Overall rejection rate: 0.827
NumRev    NumMs   rejection rate
0   306   0.977
1   2     0.5
2   228   0.68
3   86    0.698
4   4     0.75

## Bonus -- CSB Exercise 3: The Evolution of Cooperation

Why are some animals (including humans) cooperating? What gives rise to
complex social organizations and reciprocity? These fascinating questions can
be studied using game theory, made popular in evolutionary biology by May-
nard Smith (1982). One of the most well-studied problems in game theory is
the “prisoner’s dilemma”: two prisoners are suspected of a crime and interro-
gated in separate rooms; each prisoner is given the possibility to either betray
the other, or remain silent. If both remain silent (i.e., they cooperate), they
each get 1 year in prison; if one remains silent (cooperates) and the other
betrays (defects), the one who remained silent is sentenced to 3 years, while
the other is let free; finally, if each betrays the other (defects), both receive a
term of 2 years. Mathematically, one can show that if the game is played only
once, defecting is the safest strategy (Nash equilibrium). But what if the game
is played over and over? Then the mathematics becomes difficult, as the best
choice depends on the choices of other players.
Axelrod’s brilliant idea (Axelrod, 1980a) was to invite game theorists,
sociologists, psychologists, and mathematicians to submit programs imple-
menting different strategies for a game of iterated prisoner’s dilemma. Each
program would have access to the history of the moves played so far, and
based on this would decide a move. Each submission then competed against
itself, as well as against each other program, in a round-robin tournament.

1. Implement the following five strategies:
(a) always cooperate
(b) always defect
(c) random: cooperate with probability 12 , and defect otherwise
(d) tit for tat: cooperate on the first turn, then do whatever the other
player did in the previous turn
(e) tit for two tat: start by cooperating, and defect only if the other
player has defected twice in a row
Each strategy should be a function, accepting as input a list storing the
previous turns of the game, and returning 1 for cooperate and 0 for
defect.
2. Write a function that accepts the names of two strategies and plays them
against each other in a game of iterated prisoner’s dilemma for a given
number of turns. Who wins between random and always_defect ? And
between random and tit_for_tat ?
3. [Advanced] Implement a round-robin tournament in which each strat-
egy is played against every other (including against itself) for 10 rounds
of 1000 turns each. Who is the winner? 20
