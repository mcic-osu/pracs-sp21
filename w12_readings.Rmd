## Content overview for this week

***There is another instructional break this week, so we will only meet on Tuesday.***

This week, you will learn about using regular expressions in Python.
We already talked a fair bit about regular expressions in week 4 and used them with
`grep` and `sed` in the Shell.
Regular expressions are shared across all programming languages
but there are slightly different "dialects" in use by different languages.
We'll see that Python's syntax, as exposed by the `re` module,
is similar to but a bit easier to use than that in Bash
(e.g., no need to turn on extended regex!),
and that there is some additional functionality too.

**Some of the things you will learn this week:**

- All common regular expression constructs and their syntax in Python:
  metacharacters, character classes (AKA sets), quantifiers, anchors, and alternations.

- Why and how we need to define regular expressions as "raw strings".

- Different functions in Python's `re` module that can be used to match and replace text.

- How you can use and refer back to "groupings" in regular expressions for
  fine-grained matching and extraction of sub-matches within larger matches.  

## Readings

This week's chapter, CSB's "Regular Expressions", is relatively short and straightforward.
Yet learning how to use regular expressions can be extremely useful!

### Required readings

- [CSB](https://library.ohio-state.edu/record=b8624007~S7) Chapter 5: "Regular Expressions"

- MÃ¶lder et al. 2020, Zenodo:
  "[Sustainable data analysis with Snakemake](https://zenodo.org/record/4240139)"

### Further resources

- Dive Into Python is a nice and free online book on Python, and its
  [chapter on regular expressions](https://diveintopython3.problemsolving.io/regular-expressions.html)
  is particularly good.
  
- [Regex101](https://regex101.com/#python)
  is a useful website to translate regular expressions into plain
  English and to test your code on example text.
