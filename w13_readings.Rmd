### Content overview for this week

Since Snakemake is a Python program,
its syntax is very similar to regular Python and we can even include plain
Python code!
Our previous experience with Python 
therefore puts us in a really good position to learn Snakemake.

While its learning curve is not trivial even with all of our pre-existing knowledge,
there are many advantages to using Snakemake when you have analysis pipelines that include at least a few scripts.
For example, it makes our analysis pipelines more reproducible, portable, scalable,
and transparent than regular Bash or Python scripts that glue together a pipeline.
In addition, Snakemake takes care of a lot of boilerplate code for you,
such as SLURM directives in shell scripts;
and you can even forego using shell scripts altogether and specify all shell
commands in a "Snakefile" (workflow script) directly.
Finally, Snakemake can be an incredible timesaver when errors occur in your
pipeline or you need to repeat parts of it -- which is common!

**Some of the things you will learn this week:**

- What challenges you can (will) run into when trying to glue analysis pipelines
  together with regular Bash (or Python) scripts.

- What Workflow Management Systems are, and why they are useful.

- The basics of using Snakemake to describe and run workflows.

- How to get Snakemake to submit SLURM jobs for you. 

### Readings

Since neither of the books cover Snakemake,
you'll be reading two articles:
a journalistic feature article in Nature as a light introduction to workflow systems,
and a manuscript by some of the authors of Snakemake.

In the latter article,
I recommend you read until you reach the heading "2.2.1 Modularization" on page 7,
and beyond there, you can skim/read/skip as you see fit.

You may also want to (re)visit the section
"Make and Makefiles: Another Option for Pipelines" in the Buffalo book,
Chapter 12, p. 421-423.
Snakemake was heavily inspired by Make (hence its name)
but is much more user-friendly and has many more options.
