This week's readings are **all optional**.

The choice of the first chapter for the Buffalo book may seem strange,
but much of what is written there would have been a better fit for the end of the book,
in my opinion -- and should be a useful read.

Despite the title suggesting a focus on workflow systems only,
the Reiter et al. paper is broader and covers and ties together many of the topics
discussed in this course.
