## Git Setup

*These instructions are for setting up Git at OSC,
but from Step 3 onwards,
you can also follow them to set up Git for your local computer.*

1. Open up a terminal at OSC: go to <https://ondemand.osc.edu>,
   log in, click on `Clusters` in the top blue bar,
   and then on `Pitzer Shell Access`.
   (Alternatively, if you know how to, you can `ssh`
   in from your local shell.)

2. Load the Git module (*note*: Git is available in any OSC shell without
   loading any modules, but this is a rather old version):
   
   ```sh
   module load git/2.18.0
   ```

3. Use `git config` to make your name known to Git.
   Note that this should be your *actual name*, and not your Github username:
   
   ```sh
   git config --global user.name 'John Doe'
  ````

4. Use `git config` to make your email address known to Git.
   *Make sure that you use the same email address you used to sign up for Github*.
   
   ```sh
   git config --global user.email 'doe.391@osu.edu'
   ```

5. Occasionally, when you need to provide Git with a "commit message" to Git and
   you haven't entered one on the command line,
   Git will open up a text editor for you.
   Even though we'll be mostly be working in VS Code during this course,
   in this case, it is better to select a text editor that can be run within the
   terminal, like `nano` (or `vim` if you are familiar with it)
   To specify Nano as your default text editor for Git:

   ```sh
   git config --global core.editor "nano -w"
   
   # You could set VS Code as your editor on your local computer,
   # if you use it there:
   # git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
   ```

5. Check whether you successfully changed the settings:

   ```sh
   git config --global --list
   
   # user.name=John Doe
   # user.email=doe.39@osu.edu
   # colour.ui=true
   # core.editor=nano -w
   ```

6. Make sure you see `colour.ui=true` in the list (like above),
   so Git output will use colors.
   If you don't see this line, set it using:
  
   ```sh
   git config --global color.ui true
   ```

## Github Setup

### Github authentication: Background

To be able to link local Git repositories to their online counterparts on
Github, we need to set up Github authentication.

Regular password access (over `HTTP`/`HTTPS`) is now "deprecated" by Github,
and two better options are to set up `SSH` access with an *SSH key*,
or `HTTPS` access with a *Public Access Token*.

We'll use `SSH`, as it is easier -- though still a bit of drag --
and because learning this procedure will also be useful
for when you'll be setting up SSH access to the Ohio Supercomputer Center.
(But note that Github now labels `HTTPS` access as the preferred method.)

For everything on Github, there are separate SSH and HTTPS URLs,
and Github will always show you both types of URLs.
When using `SSH`, we need to use URLs with the following format:

```sh
git@github.com:<USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY>.git
```

(And when using `HTTPS`, you would use URLS like
`https://github.com/<USERNAME>/<REPOSITORY>.git`)


### Setting up Github SSH authentication

*These instructions are for setting up authentication at OSC,
but you can repeat the same steps to set up authentication for your local computer.*

1. In a terminal at OSC, use the `ssh-keygen` command to generate a public-private
  *SSH key pair* like so:

   ```sh
   ssh-keygen -t rsa
   ```

2. You'll be asked three questions, and for all three,
   you can accept the default by just pressing `Enter`:
  
   ```sh
   # Enter file in which to save the key (<default path>):
   # Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
   # Enter same passphrase again: 
   ```

  </p>

3. Now, you have a file called `id_rsa.pub` in your `~/.ssh` folder,
   which is your **public key**. To enable authentication,
   we will put this public key on Github &ndash; our public key interacts
   with our *private key*, which we do *not* share.  
   Print the public key to screen using `cat`:
  
   ```sh
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

4. Copy the public key, i.e. the contents of the public key file, to your clipboard.
   Make sure you get all of it,
   including the "`ssh-rsa`" part (but beware that your new prompt may
   start on the same line as the end the key):

   </p>

5. In your browser, go to <https://github.com> and log in.

6. Go to your personal Settings.
   (Click on your avatar in the far top-right of the page,
   and select `Settings` in the drop-down menu.)

7. Click on `SSH and GPG keys` in the sidebar.

8. Click the green `New SSH key` button.

9. Give the key an arbitrary, informative name, e.g. "OSC" to indicate that you
   are using this key at OSC.

10. Paste the public key, which you copied to your clipboard earlier,
    into the box.

   </p>

11. Click the green `Add SSH key` button. Done!
